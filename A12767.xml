            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">R</seg>Eader;</hi> The publiſhing of this Treatiſe, ſubmits it to thy judgment. It may be thou wilt judge it of little worth, becauſe thou eſteemeſt 1. the Authors credit to be ſmall, 2. the Art it ſelfe to be obſcure, and 3. of little vſe, and 4. the worke to be imperfect, and 5. vnfitly put forth in the Engliſh tongue. But this Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face ſhall make it cleare, thou art miſtaken in all theſe particulars.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Though my own credit be ſmall: yet this neede not hinder thy good liking, becauſe my labour is but to collect out of other Authors. So that if the credit of Authors will pleaſe thee, I need not feare thy diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, for here thou haſt Authors of all ages, and of the beſt account, yea <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> himſelfe, the Prince of Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers (as the learned vſe to call
<pb facs="tcp:18357:3"/>him) leads thee the way, and guides the whole game.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Some account the art it ſelfe of <hi>Logicke</hi> to be obſcure, and therefore hard to be attained: but though this were true, yet is it worthy of all that honour that is due to any humane art whatſoever, becauſe the difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie ariſeth not from the thing it ſelfe: (for it agrees to humane reaſon, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no more but a comprehenſion of precepts, directing the vſe of true reaſon) but from mans defect, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing either vnable for want of natural parts, or vnwilling through idlenes to learne it. But grant this Art were in it ſelfe obſcure, yet is it no leſſe honourable for that, becauſe ſilver, gold, and other pretious mettals are hard to obtaine: yet are they high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly eſteemed of (as daily experience ſhews) for what labour will not men take, and what hazard will they not vndergoe to get and hold them? Nay
<pb facs="tcp:18357:3"/>I adde further, that the difficultie of attaining vnto this Art, makes it more honourable when it is attai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned; for things hardly gotten are rare, and rare things are pretious, eſpecially when they are of excellent vſe: and ſuch is this Art of <hi>Logicke,</hi> as my anſwer to the next will ſhew.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Many are of opinion, that <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicke</hi> is vnprofitable, &amp; of little vſe, as ſerving to exerciſe the witts of yong Schollers, and that therefore when they grow vnto yeares, they doe wholly neglect it. This judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is erronious; for whatſoever tends to ſome good, is truely profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table: and this is the caſe with the precepts of <hi>Logicke,</hi> becauſe hereby (in ſome ſort) is healed the wound we received in our reaſon by <hi>Adams</hi> fall: and this daily tryall teacheth, becauſe by the precepts of <hi>Logicke,</hi> things hidden and darke, are cleare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly objected to our judgement. Truth
<pb facs="tcp:18357:4"/>and falſhood is made to ſtand naked before our knowledge.</p>
            <p>It may be ſome will conceiue that mans naturall <hi>Logicke</hi> will ſerue ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently for the foreſaid ends, and that therefore there is no neede of precepts.</p>
            <p>I anſwer. True it is, many mans naturall parts are ripe and prompt, ſo as they are ſpeedy and ſound in judging. But this is not every mans caſe, therfore vnto ſuch the precepts of Art are needfull. Yea, I ſay, that ſuch precepts are needfull to the prompteſt witts, for man hath not now ſo ample vſe of reaſon as <hi>Adam</hi> had at his firſt Creation, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he needs the helpe o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> artificiall precepts.</p>
            <p>To conclude, ſince the Art of <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicke</hi> is no more but a Directour of true Reaſon: the more logicall a man is, the more is he like a man, and the leſſe logicall, the leſſe like a man
<pb facs="tcp:18357:4"/>who is a reaſonable Creature. If this be true (as it is moſt true) then muſt it be granted that the precepts of this Art, are profitable for the vſe of man in the higheſt degree.</p>
            <p n="4">4. This worke is not imperfect, becauſe no precept, eſſentiall vnto <hi>Logicke,</hi> is wanting. I haue indeed o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted the modality and converſion of propoſitions and Elenchs: but this breeds no defect in the art, for theſe three appertaine to the expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of the precepts of this Art: they are no eſſentiall precepts ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. 1. The modalitie of propoſitions doth explicate the ſubject or predi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate of the propoſition wherein it is. 2. The Converſion of a propoſition is no more, but the right placing of things not rightly placed in a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition. And 3. Elenchs are the detections of falſhood in the forme of ſyllogiſmes.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Our Mother Tongue doth not
<pb facs="tcp:18357:5"/>diſgrace this Art of <hi>Logicke</hi> to the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> no more then <hi>Greeke</hi> did to the <hi>Grecians,</hi> or the <hi>Latine</hi> to the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes:</hi> for if it had, then would not <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> haue written his <hi>Logicke</hi> in Greeke, nor <hi>Tully</hi> his in Latine. We haue the holy Scriptures in our mother tongue, without diſgrace thervnto, why then ſhould it be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gracefull to <hi>Logicke?</hi> Beſides, ſome men vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d not Latin, &amp; yet haue they neede of <hi>Logicke,</hi> becauſe they need the helps to the vſe of reaſon.</p>
            <p>Thus (I hope) full ſatisfaction is given to every doubt that might hinder thy profit by this art now of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fred vnto thee: ſo as nothing more ſeemes needfull, or worthy thy la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour and mine: therefore here I will end all that I haue to ſay for this thing.</p>

               <p>Thus, haue I ſet downe,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> all that I finde in <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> touching the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of thoſe arguments, which are contained in the firſt place, or ſeat of arguments: (for this time we muſt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the conſideration of the ſecond ſubſtance; for, that hath the laſt place in this firſt part of <hi>Logick</hi>) The firſt ſubſtance comes now to be handled: <hi>Thomas</hi> doth wholly ſubſcribe vnto <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> for this diſtinction, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of ſubſtance, reported out of <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> and, he ſhewes the ſame, in this ſhort ſentence: viz <hi>In the name of firſt ſubſtance, is intended the nature of univerſall and parts.</hi> 1. <hi>p.q.</hi> 29. <hi>art.</hi> 3. <hi>ad</hi> 2<hi rend="sup">m</hi>. And, for further explication, he ſaith, 1. <hi>p. q</hi> 75. <hi>art.</hi> 2. <hi>ad</hi> 2<hi rend="sup">m</hi>. <hi>A firſt, or individuall ſubſtance, may be taken two wayes: one way, for every thing that hath a ſubſtance; another way, for a compleat ſubſiſtency, in the nature of any ſpecies: from whence, a mans hand may be called a firſt ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, or an individuall thing, after the firſt ſort: but not after the ſecond:</hi> ſo alſo, <hi>a mans ſoule, may be called a first
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:18357:14"/>ſubſtance, or a ſingular thing in the firſt ſort: becauſe, it is (as it were) a thing, that ſubſiſteth: but, that which is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded of ſoule, and bodie, is called, a firſt ſubſtance, or an individuall being, in the ſecond ſence.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Vnto this place, muſt be referred, every individual effect, as it conſiſteth by force of all the cauſes, and, every individuall ſubiect, that receiveth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny outward change, whether it be by the ſubſtracting of ſomething inioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or the receiving of ſomething that is added.</p>
               <p>The nature of theſe effects, and ſubiects, is delivered by <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> in his tenth place, or ſeat of arguments, viz. <hi>of ſuffering.</hi> I ſay, they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained there; for, in the judgement of <hi>Thomas.</hi> 1. <hi>p.q.</hi> 79. <hi>art. To ſuffer, is no more, but, to loſe things inioyed, whether appertaining to nature, or not appertaining thereto, or, to be brought from power to act:</hi> and therefore, <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſtotles</hi> tenth ſeat, of ſuffering, impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth the whole nature, of every indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viduall effect, and ſubiect, as it is an
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:18357:14"/>effect, and ſubiect. Now, I conceiue, that, this is wholy agreeable vnto <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſtotles</hi> meaning; becauſe, in his doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of predicated arguments, hee ſpeakes not a word, of effects, and ſubiects.</p>
               <p>This Doctrine is peculiar to <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtotle:
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Ramus</hi> doth not acknowledge it; for, he hath not a word of it: It may bee, he conceived, that, 1. To ſet downe all the ſeats of arguments in one place together, would breed a needles repetition. 2. Theſe ſingle termes did not appertaine to <hi>Logick.</hi> 3. The firſt ſubſtance, or thing ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iected, in every ſentence, hath not the nature of an argument. It is very like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that, he thought thus; becauſe, this doctrine of <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> hath beene anciently receiued; therefore, hee would not depart from it vnles hee had ſome reaſon for it: and I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue, he had no reaſon, but theſe 3. I anſwer, theſe three arguments bee inſufficient: The firſt, becauſe <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtotle</hi> doth neuer repeat; or handle theſe ten ſeates of arguments twiſe:
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:18357:15"/>but, in ſtead of them ſometime hee brings in the doctrine of a definition, Propertie, Genus, Accident, as the things, which are contained, in thoſe ten ſeates of arguments: and, this wee finde <hi>in the</hi> 8. <hi>and</hi> 9. <hi>chapters</hi> of the firſt <hi>booke of his Topicks.</hi> Some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther time, he ſets out, the nature of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther arguments: but, they are ſuch, as are either, contained in theſe 4. or ariſe from them; and, (at moſt) hee doth but explicate at large, the ſame things, that he had ſet downe ſumma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily, in the 10. places aforeſaid.</p>
               <p>Neither,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> is the ſecond reaſon good: for, thoſe 10. things, are propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, not as me<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>re and ſimple beings: but, in reſpect of that reflection, or relation which ariſeth out of them, vnto our vnderſtanding; for, he doth intend them, as they may bee fit to ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue, and ſerue vnto the framing of diſputations, either in ſingle propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, or in ſyllogiſmes, as himſelfe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly ſheweth, in the 8. and 9. chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters alledged: and, this is alſo evident, by the properties which he aſſigneth
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:18357:15"/>vnto them: <hi>viz, They containe truth, or falſhood, affirmation, or negation, when one of them is attributed to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The third alſo is inſufficient,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> for the firſt ſubſtance, or ſubiect part of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſentence, hath truly, and properly, the nature of an argument, for, it hath a relation, or emanation vnto many things, that may be added, or attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to it: ſo as, we conceiue it to be, a receptiue thing, 1. of the cauſes wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of it is compounded, and conſtituted. 2. of the properties flowing from it, 3. and of outward additions, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it is beautified and made to differ, and diſſent from other, and whereby it is made equall, or vnequall, like or vnlike vnto others: as we ſhall playn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſee, when we come to the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars; and, it is plaine, that <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> vnderſtood that argument, which he calls the firſt ſubſtance, after this ſort: for, in the ſayd 5 <hi>chapter of his Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gories, he ſayth, it is proper vnto the firſt ſubſtance to receiue contraries, as ſicknes, and health, blacknes, and whitnes, and
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:18357:16"/>thereby to be changed, from well to ill, from white to blacke.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The onely doubt is, whether an individuall effect, and ſubiect bee ſome wayes predicated or not. <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus</hi> ſayth yea; and brings them as predicated arguments. <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> doth not ſo, and no doubt, he hath the truth. No indiuiduall effect, is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated. I haue three reaſons for it: firſt, we neuer find any ſuch predica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in the formall writings in the ſchooles, 2. No man can ſay, this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diuiduall thing conſiſting of ſoule, and bodie, is this man: for, the predicate is leſſe knowne then the ſubiect; The ſubiect engendreth diſtinct and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine knowledge: becauſe, it compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hendeth all the cauſes, but no man will ſay ſo, of the predicate, nor ſo much, 3. The authority of the ſchools is againſt it. I will alleadge <hi>Thomas</hi> for them all. An <hi>integrall whole</hi> (ſayth he) 1. <hi>p. 1.</hi> 77. <hi>art.</hi> 1. <hi>ad</hi> 1<hi rend="sup">m</hi>. <hi>is not predicated of all the parts together, vnles improperly as when we ſay, theſe walls, this foundation, and roofe, is this
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:18357:16"/>houſe.</hi> For the ſubiect; the matter is yet more cleere, we cannot ſay, this learning, is this man. <hi>Thomas</hi> ſayth truly 1. <hi>p. q.</hi> 29. <hi>art.</hi> 3. <hi>ad</hi> 3<hi rend="sup">m</hi> 
                  <hi>Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents doe mans eſt the ſubiect:</hi> but hee neuer ſayd, nor any man elſe, that, the ſubiect doth manifeſt the acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent; and no maruaile why: for, if the ſubiect be predicated of the acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, then we muſt conceiue, that, the accident is without, and before the ſubiect: but no man will ſay ſo: ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, we may conclude, the indiui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duall effect, and ſubiect, are fitly comprehended vnder the name of a firſt ſubſtance. Thus, I haue ſet downe, and explicated, the generall nature of arguments; and, the ſpeciall nature of that argument, which is alwayes ſubiected or argued. In the next place, I come to thoſe arguments, which be alway predicated.</p>

               </head>
               <q>The Efficient Cauſe is that,
<note place="margin">Ramus.</note>from which, the thing is.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>[Efficient]</hi> This word imports no more;
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> but, to doe, or to bring to paſſe: and, therefore, it ſignifieth, the office of all the Cauſes, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, it ſeemes not fit to be given vnto any one Cauſe diſtinctly: yet notwithſtanding, we muſt know, that there is good reaſon thus to call it; elſe, the learned of all ages would not haue giuen it that name; yea, the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry nature of it deſerues we ſhould call it ſo: as we ſhall ſee in the next paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>[From which]</hi> Theſe words doe ſet out the nature,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> or office of that Cauſe, which is called Efficient: and ſignifie the originall, or fountaine, from whence the effect doth receiue tts being. I ſay the effect, and I meane
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:18357:20"/>the whole effect: for, this Cauſe doth ioyne together all the other Cauſes, whereof the effect is compounded: as namely, it beſtoweth the forme vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the matter, and doth deſtinate the matter formed vnto the producing of ſomething that is good: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, it deſerues well to be called Effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient. The forme doth make the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect to be of this, or that kinde: the matter formed, doth make the effect to be this, or that individuall thing: the end makes it fit for this or that good: but, the motion and efficacy of the efficient Cauſe onely, doth giue being vnto the effect in the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent. Wee haue many examples of this Cauſe, and the operation thereof; we finde one in the ſecond of <hi>Geneſis,</hi> the ſeaventh verſe, where it is ſayd,
<q>God formed man, of the duſt of the ground, and breathed into him the breath of life, and he became a liu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſoule.</q>
               </p>
               <p>In this example, the making of man is attributed vnto God: therefore God is ſayd to be the Efficient Cauſe of
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:18357:21"/>man: the office of this efficiency, is placed in ioyning the forme vnto the matter; he framed him of the duſt, there is the matter, and breathed life into him, and thereby the forme is impoſed on the matter, and then, God did deſtinate him to an end, <hi>viz.</hi> The actions of life, thereby he made him a living ſoule.</p>
               <p>We haue another the like example in the 11. of <hi>Geneſis,</hi> the 3. and 4. ver. where it is reported; that,
<q>The men of the earth, did build a high tower of bricke, and ſlime; for a memoriall of their name.</q>
               </p>
               <p>The men of the earth, are made the builders of the tower, and thereby they became the efficient cauſe of the whole worke: they take bricke, and frame it into a tower; therefore, they ioyne the matter and forme together: they deſtinate the ſame vnto an end; <hi>viz.</hi> the continuance of their name on earth. And, thus much ſhall ſuffice, to ſet out the nature of the efficient cauſe. Wee ſhould now divide an ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient cauſe into the ſeverall kindes;
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:18357:21"/>but, that we cannot: for (as <hi>Ramus</hi> truely ſayes) <hi>they are vnknowne vnto vs, therefore we will ſet downe, the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, and various manner, wherein the efficient cauſe doth worke: for that is well knowne, and doth helpe vs much, in the vnderſtanding of the office of thus Cauſe.</hi>

               <p>We finde this diſtinction,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> and the explication thereof, in the Schooles of all ages. <hi>The efficient cauſe</hi> (ſayth <hi>Thomas</hi>) <hi>workes, by it ſelfe, or by acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent; the firſt is, when it moneth by its owne proper vertue: The ſecond, when ſomething is remoued therefrom, or that which remaines, is hindred from work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> 1<hi rend="sup">a</hi>. 2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="34" facs="tcp:18357:22"/>worketh by a thing different from it ſelfe, and a cauſe, which workes by it ſelfe is that, which cauſeth the effect ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to its proper nature, and not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to ſome other thing, which out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly doth befall it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The efficient doth worke by it ſelfe, in naturall things, when it moues ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording vnto the inſtinct, and inbred diſpoſition of nature: as when the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Creature ſeeth, eateth, ſleepeth, avoydeth knowne danger. The plants grow vpright, bring forth leaues, and fruit, in due ſeaſon; So doth it worke by it ſelfe in the intellectuall creature, when man moues himſelfe vnto do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, by the direction of true reaſon, and the vnreſtrained, and free choyſe of the will.</p>
               <p>Naturall things doe worke by acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, when the inſtinct of nature is ſuppreſſed, or diverted. The intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectuall creature workes by accident, when the iudgement of reaſon is er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronious, and the choyſe of the will, carried by a previall over-ruling pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and all theſe doe fall out, in caſe,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:18357:22"/>where nature meets with defection. The vnderſtanding is poſſeſſed with ignorance, or the will haled by the naughtineſſe of corruption, and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of temptation. Laſtly, <hi>the ſecret providence of God (which the Heathen called fortune) makes the creature work by accident:</hi> in all Caſes when he workes againſt meanes, as he did, when he brought the people through the red Sea, <hi>Exodus</hi> the 14. and, as he doth in all miracles; or when man intendeth one thing, but another thing comes to paſſe: of this, we haue an example in the 45. of <hi>Geneſis,</hi> and 5. verſ. &amp; 37. &amp; 27. verſe. In this place, they are ſayd to ſell <hi>Ioſeph,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they would be rid of him; and, in that, <hi>Ioſeph</hi> ſayth, <hi>God ſent him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Aegypt, to preſerue their liues.</hi> They were the efficient Cauſe of their owne preſerving, when they ſold <hi>Ioſeph;</hi> but, yet by accident, through Gods ſecret providence, that wrought contrary to their intent. The <hi>Iewes,</hi> likewiſe, were the Cauſe of Chriſts glory, and mans ſalvation,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:18357:23"/>when they delivered him to death; but, yet by accident, becauſe God himſelfe did create light out of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and made their evill intention, ſerue vnto that good. There be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny examples, wherein wee finde, that, the efficient cauſe doth worke on this manner: but theſe are enough, for this preſent.</p>

A Phyſicall operation, is a reall influence into the effect, we haue an example of this in mans crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: He formed him, and that of the duſt, and poured life into him, all theſe be reall influences: of this kinde,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:18357:23"/>are the builders of the Tower of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bell,</hi> they made bricke, and reard a building with bricke, and ſtone: Of this ſort, be all workemen that labour with their hands, and tooles, the ſtrength of nature, doth immediatly flow into the thing that is wrought, making a reall and ſenſible change in the matter where on they worke.</p>
               <p>A morall worke, is a motion of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to the vnderſtanding, and ſerues to allure, and draw it on with reaſons, and perſwaſion. Of this kinde, bee be all ſuch things, as be obiected to the vnderſtanding, as namely, the teſtimonie of God, and man, by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding, forbidding, promiſing, threatning, perſwading, therefore, ſo often as wee finde, any of theſe attributed to God, or man, wee are to know, that then they are effici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent cauſes, that worke morally.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ramus doth call Teſtimonies, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortations, Commandements, &amp;c. in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>artificiall arguments, becauſe, they argue, not of their owne force, but, by the authoritie of him that doth teſtifie:</hi>
                  <pb n="38" facs="tcp:18357:24"/>but, this is altogether vnfitly ſpoken, for inartificiall, and argument, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyes a contradiction, if inartificiall, then no argument; if an argument then artificiall, for an argument is a member of Art. 2. Theſe things them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues are no arguments, vnleſſe they be referred vnto the Teſtator, but then they argue as properties or ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juncts, and otherwayes they are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver attributed to any ſubject. In this place affirmation, perſwaſion, &amp;c. are not brought as morall cauſes in themſelues: but the cauſalitie is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to him that affirmeth, perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth &amp;c. which makes it very plaine, that, they belong to this place or ſeat of arguments. God, and his ſervants, are the morall cauſes of mans holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, when they command good, and forbid ill, when they promiſe good, and threaten ill, when they perſwade vnto obedience, and diſſwade from ſinne, thus our Saviour Chriſt is the morall cauſe of all ſupernaturall things, when by his obedience, he deſerved, that God ſhould beſtow
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:18357:24"/>them vpon vs, he by meriting (I ſay) is the morall cauſe of Gods gifts, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe by his merits hee moveth God to beſtow them: and ſo much ſhall ſuffice for this diſtinction.</p>

               <p>This diſtinction is very ancient in the ſchooles; and of great vſe, when we deſire to know, how mans will is wrought vpon, and worketh with the actuall motion of Gods grace; <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varez</hi> received it from <hi>Thomas,</hi> and makes vſe of it. <hi>diſp.</hi> 68. <hi>no.</hi> 5. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> where, hee doth thus deſcribe each member of it.</p>

                  <hi>A principall efficient is that, which worketh out of its owne power, or forme, as Thomas</hi> ſayth, 1. <hi>p. q.</hi> 18. <hi>art.</hi> 3. <hi>in cor.</hi> A firſt principall efficient, is that which worketh onely, out of its owne power. Thus God only work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:18357:25"/>of whom it is ſayd, <hi>hee ſitteth in Heaven, and doth what he will.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>A ſecond principall efficient is that, which is ſo moved by another, that it moveth it ſelfe, by a power of its owne. Of this ſort is mans mind, which is mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by God,</hi> yet neverth leſſe it work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth out of an actiue beginning, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining in it ſelfe, Of this ſort, be all thoſe ſayings in the Scripture, which attribute mans good workes, as his converſion, and the like, ſometimes, vnto God alone, and other ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, vnto man alone.</p>

                  <hi>An inſtrument (properly taken,

               <p>In man we haue a full repreſentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of every part of this Argument.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> Wee ſay, rationalitie is the formall cauſe of man. Now, 1. Rationalitie is the intrinſecall part of man, all other of his parts, are more overt, and better knowne. 2. Rationalitie hath a force to beſtow a being vpon man: for, when God had drawne together the duſt of the earth, man had not (as then) his being: but, he receiued that, when God breathed the breath of life into it: at that time (I ſay) and not before, man became a liuing ſoule. 3. Rationalitie beſtowes vpon man a being, that is actuall, and determined vnto one, and actiue; whereby he is fit to doe the actions of life. 4. There is nothing eſſentiall vnto man; but his rationalitie beſtowes it on him: The body (indeed) doth make him a ſingular man, by retaining, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracting the ſoule vnto one: but, in what reſpect he is a man, that he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiues wholy from his ſoule, and from hence, <hi>the forme is truely ſayd to be the beginning of difference, that is he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:18357:30"/>one and another, and not the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference it ſelfe. Thom.</hi> 1. <hi>diſt.</hi> 25. <hi>q.</hi> 1. <hi>art.</hi> 1. <hi>ad</hi> 2<hi rend="sup">m</hi>. I ſay, the difference of things doth flow from the forme: for, as <hi>vnitie in ſubſtance doth make two things to be the ſame,</hi> as <hi>Okam</hi> doth truely teach, 1. <hi>diſt.</hi> 19. <hi>q.</hi> 1. <hi>lit.

The forme is not the difference it ſelfe: for, a forme is a ſubſiſtence in an vnitie: but, a difference is a diſſenting betweene the eſſence of two: and thus much for the explication of the formall Cauſe.</p>

               <p>An externall end, is the actuall vſe of the thing, to which the effect is fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. Thus the beatificall viſion is mans end, to which he tends. An end in the intent of the doer, is no more but either the fitnes (it ſelfe) of the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect thought vpon, and purpoſed by the efficient; (this is the condition of every workman, that deviſeth and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolueth vpon the faſhion, and forme of the thing to be wrought) Or the commoditie of the workman, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, ſought thereby.</p>
               <p>Wee haue example of an end, thus vnderſtood, in thoſe words of <hi>Iohn</hi> 3.16. <hi>God ſo loued the world &amp;c.</hi> Where the giving of Chriſt is an effect, wrought by God, wherein he inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the glory of himſelfe, and his

               <p>An end of a thing impoſed vpon it is, when the efficient inioyned that vſe of it, which the thing it ſelfe doth not yeeld, and this end we finde in lawes, and mony; the one is appointed to be a rule of obedience, the other to ſet a price of wares.

<pb n="54" facs="tcp:18357:32"/>Firſt I anſwer it can, becauſe that tendency flowes from the forme, in as much as <hi>the forme doth determine the effect vnto an end, according to its owne proportion: as the forme of ſteele is ſuch, as beſt fitteth with cutting.

               <p>Wee haue many examples that ſhew vs the nature of this argument. Fitnes to rule the day and night is attributed to the Sunne, and Moone <hi>Geneſis.</hi> 1.14.

<pb n="55" facs="tcp:18357:32"/>and help <hi>Adam</hi> is affirmed of <hi>Evah Geneſis.</hi> 2.18.21. as the end of her creation. Man is apt, and fit to loue the knowne good, and that is his end; this fitnes floweth from his reaſonable ſoule or formall being, whoſe propertie it is to judge truly, and chooſe freely. Now this fitnes hath a maine ſtroake in the conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of man, not by the way of moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, for that belongs to the efficient, nor by the way of reception, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention: for, that belongs to the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: but, by the way of ſetled poſition as the forme doth from whence it floweth. 2. By this fitnes a man is made a perfit, and compleat humane creature: for, when he attaines vnto that, he wants nothing requiſite vnto his being. Vntill he be ſo fitted, we cannot conceiue him a humane crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: for, he would differ nothing from bruit beaſts.</p>
               <p>The vſe of this argument is of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding worth,

I ſay it is certainly true, that there be ſome things proper, that be not accidents: namely, all naturall ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, as the act of ſeeing, is proper to all living creatures: the act of diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to man: The bearing of leaues, and fruit to plants: and the outward workes of holineſſe, vnto him that hath the habit of holineſſe. Theſe are proper, becauſe they are neceſſary e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manations, from nature in the one, and grace in the other: ſo as, when all requiſite circumſtances be preſent, man cannot but ſee, and worke, the plants cannot but bring forth fruit, and leaues: wherefore, the holy Ghoſt doth thus reaſon;
<q>He that doth righteouſneſſe is righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous. <bibl>

                  <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> hath not this diviſion; yet it may be allowed, becauſe, it is true, and vſefull.

Wee may truly ſay, this divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion is vſefull: for, the holy Ghoſt doth vſe it; from vnſeparable acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents he doth argue thus. <hi>Ier.</hi> 13.23. <hi>The Aethiopian cannot change his skin, nor the Leopard his ſpots, no more can he leaue his ſinne, that is accuſtomed to doe evill.</hi>

               <p>Separable accidents are alway of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular vſe,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="9"/> and doe aboundantly ſerue, to lead our vnderſtandings into the knowledg of the ſubiects, vnto which they are attributed. If we take them as they are in themſelues, and in that coniunction which is between them and the ſubiect, then they are but light, and of ſmall force to ſet out the thing we know not: but becauſe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them doe meet together in one ſubiect, therfore their number toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther makes amends for their weaknes
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:18357:37"/>ſeverally: yet, none of them are ſo weake ſeverally, but that they doe cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly leade vs to know the outward qualitie, and condition of their ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect, for learning, Riches, beautie, &amp;c. doe vndoubtedly argue their ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects to be learned, rich, and beautiful, and therby we know the condition, which the ſubiect that receiveth them doth inioy, and how they differ from others, that want riches, learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or beauty: therefore, the holy Ghoſt doth ſo often vſe this kinde of argument, and then moſt chiefly, when he would ſet out his moſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved obiect.

By this argument alſo, Goliath is ſet out 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 17.4.5.6. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Then came <hi>a man named Goliath of Gath. &amp;c.</hi> To conclude, ſuch force is in this argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that we doe certainly and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly know therby, one man from another, and what reuerence, honor, and reſpect ought to be giuen to this rather then to that: and thus <hi>Ariſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle</hi>

Now, theſe doe differ, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we conceiue this man that hath the one, differs from him that hath not that, but another: they differ from the ſubiect which they argue, but in ſome reſpect onely, namely, through the preſent condition thereof, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the ſubiect inioyeth one of them: but not the reſt.</p>
               <pb n="72" facs="tcp:18357:41"/>
               <p>I make it manifeſt by this ſentence:
<q>Socrates is temperate, but not iuſt, nor prudent.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Here, Iuſtice and prudence diſſent from <hi>Socrates,</hi> onely, in reſpect of his preſent condition, and becauſe he hath them not: this diſagreement that is betweene the ſubiect, and the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate, viz. Man, and prudence, makes a diverſitie betweene them, and no more. For, a iuſt man may al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo be prudent, and a prudent man is not another man, from him that is Iuſt.</p>
               <p>We haue examples of theſe argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments very often, we ſay in our <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> Proverbe, <hi>This man is at ods with his wits;</hi> and we meane by it, his wit, and he differs, onely, becauſe he wants it.</p>
               <p>In the ſame ſort it is ſayd,
<q>Vlyſſes was fayre, but not eloquent.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Where, cloquence differs from <hi>V<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyſſes,</hi> onely, in reſpect, that he had it not: for, otherwiſe it agreed with him no leſſe then beautie; he might haue beene the one, as well as the other,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:18357:41"/>notwithſtanding the nature of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, and that qualitie.</p>
               <p>The vſe of this kinde of argument is very behoofefull: for, hereby a man is ſhewed his error, that thinkes he hath much, when indeed he hath but little: Thus the holy Ghoſt argueth againſt the Church of <hi>Pergamus, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel.</hi> 2.12.13.14. and 15.</p>
               <q>Although thou holdeſt faſt my Name in the time of perſecution, yet thou haſt many faults; for thou entertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt the doctrine of Balaam, and the Nicolaitans.</q>
               <p>So he argueth the Church of <hi>Thy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atira,</hi> in the 19.20. and 21. Verſes.

               <p>
                  <hi>[Oppoſites]</hi> This word ſignifies ſuch things, as are ſet againſt each other.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>[Wholy diſagree]</hi> That is, both <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectiuely,</hi> becauſe the ſubiect doth
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:18357:42"/>want the thing that diſſenteth: and <hi>really,</hi> becauſe the ſubiect cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue the thing that diſſenteth: When the ſubiect, and the thing diſſenting, doth abhorre each other, and are (as we ſay) incompatible, then there is a totall oppoſition betweene them: we haue examples hereof in ſuch ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings as theſe be:
<q>
                     <l>He that is rich, is not poore.</l>
                     <l>He that is in health, is not ſicke.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>I ſay the nature of oppoſites is found in theſe, not in thoſe wherein man barely, and ſimply is ſubiected: for diſſent is in the qualitie not the quidditie, or being of the ſubiect: as hath beene ſhewed. 2. Povertie and ſicknes agrees to man barely,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> and ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply taken, and ſo they doe not oppoſe him at all: the reaſon why povertie, and ſickneſſe are oppoſite vnto a man that is rich, and in health, is becauſe riches, and povertie are of that nature that they cannot befall the ſame ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect, in the ſame reſpect, part, and time: therefore, whenſoever one of them is affirmed, the other is thereby
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:18357:43"/>denied. Thus much of oppoſites in generall; in the next place, I muſt ſet downe the ſpeciall kindes of them.</p>

<pb n="78" facs="tcp:18357:44"/>then they agree wholy with that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finition; for, then that predicate which is denied, doth oppoſe the thing argued: and I thinke that theſe authors meant thus: for, they know that the predicates themſelues con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine neither truth, nor falſhood, and therefore no oppoſition. If they ſpeake of the predicates themſelues, not at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed to ſome ſubiect, then they giue them the foundation of oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and not formall, and actuall op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition: and therefore, they agree fully with that definition, and truth: with that definition: for, it doth ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, that the foundation of formall, and actuall oppoſition is in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicates themſelues: and they agree with truth: for, it is moſt certaine, that the predicates themſelues are the foundation of formall, and actuall op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition: by reaſon they are of that nature, that if one be attributed, the reſt cannot, as is truely delivered by <hi>Ramus</hi> in this point of oppoſites: And <hi>Altaco. in</hi> 1. <hi>ſent. q.</hi> 2. <hi>lit.

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> In theſe words, the proper nature of Relatiue oppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is ſet out: and they import ſuch an oppoſition, as wherein the terms op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed doe mutually conſtitute each other. <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> teacheth the ſame, when he affirmeth, that the <hi>terms op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed bee mutually referred each to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:</hi> and denies, that mutuall refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to all other kinde of oppoſites.
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:18357:47"/>
                  <hi>Thomas</hi> alſo hath the ſame thing: <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latiues</hi> (ſaith he 1. <hi>p. q.</hi> 42. <hi>ar.</hi> 3. <hi>ad</hi> 2<hi rend="sup">m</hi>.) <hi>are together in nature, and our vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding; in aſmuch as, the one is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended in the definition of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> wherfore <hi>Ramus</hi> concludeth tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in theſe words.</p>
               <q>Becauſe of this mutuull relation,
<note place="margin">Ramus.</note>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latiues are ſayd to bee together in nature, ſo that, he which perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly knowes the one, knoweth the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther alſo.</q>
               <p>To conclude this point of Relatiue oppoſition, it may bee demanded,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> whether all Relatiues be oppoſits? I anſwere firſt; The foundation of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latiues bee Adjuncts, or Cauſes, and effects: therefore, in that reſpect, no relatiues are oppoſites. Secondly, the proper nature of relation conſiſteth onely in a reſpect, that one thing hath vnto another without it ſelfe, and ſo alſo no relatiues are oppoſites: for which cauſe, <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> makes Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiues to be conſenting arguments, as
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:18357:48"/>I haue ſhewed <hi>Chap.</hi> 3. foregoing. Thirdly, The things comprehended in the termes related, or referred, be ſuch, that, they agree not vnto the ſame ſubiect, in the ſame reſpect, part, and time: and thus all relatiues be op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſites. Fourthly, The oppoſition that is betweene the termes related, is made relatiuely, that is, each terme oppoſed hath a reſpect, and relation, the one to the other: ſo as, we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue the one is againſt the other, and the one doth conſtitute the other; neither of them can be in themſelues, nor knowne to vs, but by the one, and the other: yet when they are, they oppoſe one another; And thus, all relatiues be oppoſites. This I ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from <hi>Tho.</hi> 1. <hi>p. q.</hi> 28. <hi>Relatiues</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>ſignifie a certaine Relation of one terme vnto its oppoſite, art.</hi> 2. <hi>in cor.</hi> The <hi>nature of relation is a reſpect of one to another, according to which, one thing is oppoſed vnto another rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiuely, art.</hi> 3. <hi>in cor.</hi> Thus (I hope) this doubt is fully cleered.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> We finde the nature of theſe argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:18357:48"/>fully layd open in this ſentence.</p>
               <q>He that is Father to Socrates, is not ſonne to Socrates in the ſame reſpect, and time.</q>
               <p>Here. I Father and Sonne are terms referred the one to the other, as things that reſpect one another. 2. This re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect goeth out of the one to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the Father is a reſpect that ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth vnto the Sonne, and the Sonne a reſpect that extendeth to the Father. 3. The termes related doe mutually conſtitute one another, in their owne being, and our knowledge; the Father is, and is knowne to be, by the Sonne, and the Sonne is, &amp; is knowne to be, by the Father. 4. The foundation of this relation is Paternity, and Filialitie: now, Paternitie being referred vnto Filialitie, we finde cauſe, and effect: but Paternitie being referred vnto the Father, is an adjunct: and Filialitie is an adjunct to the Sonne. Thus farre they both conſent with the ſubiect which they argue. 5. The things com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended vnder theſe two termes cannot agree to the ſame ſubiect, in
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:18357:49"/>the ſame reſpect, and time: ſo as, now we finde them oppoſites: no man can be Father, and Sonne in the ſame re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, and at the ſame time. 6. Wee finde theſe termes of Father, and Son oppoſed relatiuely, (that is) in what ſort the one doth reſpect the other, in that ſort it is referred, as vnto its op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite: but ſo as, one terme makes the other to be in it ſelfe, and our knowledge. 7. Theſe termes of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and Sonne be contraries: for, as <hi>Thomas</hi> ſayth, <hi>Contrarietie is a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence according to the forme.</hi> 1<hi rend="sup">a</hi>. 2ae. <hi>q.</hi> 35. <hi>art.</hi> 3. <hi>&amp;</hi> 4. <hi>in cor.</hi> And ſuch a difference there is betweene Father, and Sonne, Paternitie is formally one thing, and Filialitie is formally ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. The ſame things are to be found in many other examples, as in <hi>Prince,</hi> and <hi>ſubiect: Prieſt,</hi> and <hi>people: Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,</hi> and <hi>ſervant: Seller,</hi> and <hi>buyer</hi> &amp;c. But this ſhall ſuffice, as ſufficient to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen the nature of relatiue oppoſition. In the next place we muſt come to adverſatiues.</p>

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> doe ſet out the ſpeciall nature of theſe oppoſits: and by them we vnderſtand what theſe oppoſites be, and how they differ from all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. This word ſignifies the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance, and perpetuitie of oppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that is betweene theſe oppoſites, namely, that it ceaſeth not at any time: becauſe (as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſayth) <hi>no ſubiect that is capable hereof can poſſibly be without one of them:</hi> now, in this they differ from Diſparates, and relatiues: for, every ſubiect that can be blacke, and white, may at ſome time be nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of them; ſo alſo, a man may be neither Father, nor Sonne.

                  <hi>[Directly]</hi> This word importeth an oppoſition that is without mixture,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> interpoſition, or diverſion; like vnto a ſtraight line that extendeth betweene two points, and this no doubt was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> when he ſayd, <hi>Theſe oppoſites be without relation, or a third thing to come betweene them.</hi>
                  <pb n="91" facs="tcp:18357:50"/>Herein theſe oppoſites differ from Diſparats, and relatiues, the one re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiues the interpoſing of a third: and the other admits a mixture of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting, and thereby a diverſion from oppoſing: by that relation, and reſpect that the one hath to the other. Wee haue all theſe particulars layd open to vs, in that one inſtance which wee finde in <hi>Ariſtotle:</hi> namely,
<q>He that is in health, is not ſicke.</q>
               </p>
               <p>In this example we finde, 1. one ſide ſet againſt another. 2. one poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue being is ſet againſt another; for, ſo we conceiue of ſicknes. 3. One of theſe is true of a man alwayes: he cannot be but ſicke, or well; becauſe, the temper of his bodie requires it, and therefore this oppoſition is in man alwayes, becauſe when he is ſicke, he is not well: and when he is well, he is not ſicke. 4. There is no third thing to come betweene ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, and health. 5. Sicknes is never mixed with health, nor health with
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:18357:51"/>ſicknes. 6. This oppoſition is direct: he that falls from health becomes pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently ſicke: when ſicknes is expelled, then health is preſently recovered: the one devours the other, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariwiſe, the one overcomes the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: like vnto two armies in the field, the laſt motion in fighting on the one ſide, is the firſt motion in purſuite on the other ſide: this may ſuffice for all thoſe oppoſites which doe containe poſitiue being in both terms.</p>

The one de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyes, the other affirmes, (that is) the one hath a poſitiue being, called a ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit, the other the abſence of that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit, called a privation, or priuatiue. 2. This habit, and privation is oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, not the one againſt the other, ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracted from their ſubject: but as the one is received by the ſubiect, ſo the other is ſubſtracted therfrom. 3. This ſubject whereabouts they are exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:18357:52"/>is one and the ſame: even that ſubiect, and no other is deprived that hath received the habit. 4. That ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect whereabout theſe oppoſites are exerciſed, is not every one vniverſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; but onely that wherein the habit ought to be according to the courſe of nature.</p>
               <p>The reaſon why theſe oppoſites muſt be exerciſed about ſuch a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect is;
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> becauſe nothing can truely be ſayd to be deprived, vnleſſe the thing which is remoued, be due thereto by nature. The reaſon why, to haue the habit, and to be deprived thereof, are oppoſed, is becauſe the habit and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation thereof, cannot befall the ſame ſubiect, in the ſame reſpect, part, and time.</p>
               <p>All theſe particulars are declared in that one inſtance which <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> giues,

<pb n="96" facs="tcp:18357:53"/>terms, <hi>viz.</hi> ſight, and blindneſſe. 2. The one imports a poſitiue being, the other the abſence of that being. 3. The one is affirmed, the other de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied, therefore one is oppoſed to one. 4. The things themſelues abſtracted from the ſubject are not oppoſed, but their oppoſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is exerciſed about one ſubiect. 5. One of the terms is due vnto the ſubiect wherein they oppoſe, <hi>viz.</hi> ſight is due to mans na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: for God made him a ſeeing creature. 6. The foundation of that oppoſition is in ſight, and blindneſſe, in themſelues abſtracted from their ſubiect: we deny blindnes vnto the ſame man that hath ſight: becauſe mans bodie is not capable of them both together, in the ſame reſpect, part, and time. And here I put an end, to the oppoſition of habit and privation.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>[Negatiue Contraries]</hi> One part of the Contradiction is negatiue:

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Theſe words doe place the nature of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictories in theſe properties: 1. They containe a deniall, that is, the abſence of a poſitiue nature, affirmed in the one, is implyed, or vertually avou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched in the other. 2. This deniall is made by one onely, the other alwaies containing a poſitiue nature. 3. This deniall is made vniverſally: for all times, and reſpects, and every where; and in all ſubjects, ſo as, theſe oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions containe alwayes a truth in them, whether <hi>Socrates</hi> be, or be not, one of them is alwayes true, and the other falſe: wherefore it is proper to the oppoſition of this kſnde, that one of them is true, or falſe: as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> hath truly obſerved <hi>in the tenth chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of his Categories.</hi> And the reaſon of it is good, all things that haue any
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:18357:55"/>being, muſt either continue, or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>continue in that being: from whence it is, that, <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſayth, that <hi>this op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition is made by it ſelfe, and wants the intermiſſion of a third:</hi> for no pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er can put a third thing betweene be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and not being, nor cauſe that thing not to be which is in the ſame reſpect and time, when and as it is, nor make that to be which is not in that reſpect, and during that time wherein it is not.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> and <hi>Aliaco</hi> guievs two ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples in the places alledged, that doe fully repreſent the nature of theſe oppoſites.</p>
               <q>
                  <l>He that ſitteth, doth not, not ſit.</l>
                  <l>He that is a man, is not, a not man.</l>
               </q>
               <p>Wee haue in theſe two ſentences, two terms, <hi>viz. To ſit, not to ſit. A man, a not man.</hi> The firſt of theſe terms comprehends a poſitiue, and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite nature: in the ſecond, a negation, or abſence of that poſitiue nature, (by a terme infinite, and vnlimitted) is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied.
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:18357:55"/>The firſt is affirmed of a man, the ſecond is denied of the ſame man. 3. This deniall extends to all times, and reſpects, wherein that affirmation may be conceiued. 4. This deniall is not voluntary, nor impoſed: but, ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth ſimply, and abſolutely from the nature of the things themſelues: no power can make him that is a man, not to be a man, during the time while he is a man. Neither can any power make that a man which is not a man, during the time wherein he is not a man. 5. It is alwayes true, or falſe of this, or that ſingular man, that either he is, or that he is not, there can be no third moment aſſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, wherein he neither is, nor is not. So as with this I may put an end to Contradictory oppoſition, and the explication of all poſitiue arguments, both Conſenting, and Diſſenting.</p>

                  <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> delivers the doctrine of theſe arguments,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> fully, and plainely enough, as we ſhall ſee anon.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>[Comparatiue]</hi> Theſe Arguments are oppoſed vnto poſitiue, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, they haue a ſenſe oppoſite to them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>[Compared together]</hi> Theſe words doe ſet out the ſpeciall nature of theſe arguments: they are called Compara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue, becauſe they are compared with other things; and this nature conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth in two things: Firſt, they are compared. Secondly, they are argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, by meanes of that comparing.
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:18357:56"/>Things are compared together when the one is meaſured, waighed, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciphered by the other; Thus timber is compared with the rule; wares are compared with the waights, and the picture with the thing pictured: and thus we vnderſtand the word <hi>Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red</hi> in this place. A ſingle terme be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes a compared argument, when it hath ſuch a force to argue, or ſet out the ſubiect, as is receiued from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing, that it is compared with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all: and herein, theſe arguments haue an oppoſite nature vnto poſitiue: for, they borrow no force to argue from the qualitie, or quantitie of any other arguments.</p>
               <p>Theſe arguments haue theſe foure properties. 1.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 
                  <hi>They are equally knowne</hi>] (that is) the two things compared, haue in themſelues no prioritie, or antecedency, to argue, and be argued: as we finde in the effect, and cauſes thereof: In the ſubiect, and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties, and accidents annexed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto. 2. <hi>[Some men doe know the one better then the other.]</hi> That is, in the
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:18357:57"/>event, by reaſon they are acquainted with the one, and not with the other. 3. <hi>[They are taken ſometimes, from things faigned.]</hi> And ſo, they may well be; for, ſuch things haue a being in our vnderſtanding, and that is enough to make them <hi>rationall beings;</hi> as wee learne from <hi>Thomas,</hi> 1 <hi>part. q.</hi> 16. <hi>art.</hi> 3. <hi>ad</hi> 2<hi rend="sup">m</hi>. That is enough alſo, to giue them a place in <hi>Logick:</hi> for every be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as well rationall, as reall is obiec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted thereunto. 4. <hi>[Compariſons taken from fained things doe argue, and ſet out the ſubiect.]</hi> Becauſe, the force that all compariſons haue to argue, ariſeth from the apprehenſion of our vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding; and not from any reall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, or conſent that the one hath to the other.</p>
               <p>Now,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> becauſe the Reader might know, how to finde a Compariſon in a Diſcourſe, wee muſt vnderſtand, that, <hi>ſometimes they are ſet out by cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine words, which are proper to them: and ſometimes they lie open in ſentences that are fit to expreſſe them: In this caſe the firſt ſentence is called the propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition:

               <p>
                  <hi>Not onely, but alſo. Rather this, then that: More then: Much more.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Examples of theſe Compariſons, are theſe which follow.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I am readie, not to be bound onely: but alſo, to dye for the name of the Lord Ieſus.</hi> Act 21.13.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I had rather be a dore-keeper in Gods houſe, then dwell in the tents of wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes. Pſal.</hi> 84.10.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Lord loueth the gates of Sion, more then all the dwellings of Iacob.</hi> Pſal. 82.2.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If, when wee were enemies, wee were
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:18357:62"/>reconciled to God, by the death of his ſonne: much more, being reconciled, we ſhall be ſaved by his life.</hi> Rom. 5.6.7.</p>
               <p>In theſe examples, we haue theſe Compariſons. <hi>To be bound, and to dye,</hi> doe differ in the quantitie of bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, &amp; this is eſteemed to exceed that. <hi>To keepe a dore, and to dwell in the tents &amp;c.</hi> are layd together, and this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred before that, in mans judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as exceeding in the quantitie of excellency. <hi>The gates of Sion,</hi> are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with the other <hi>dwellings of Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell,</hi> in the quantitie of glory, and loue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lines, and theſe preferred before that. The <hi>reconciling of an enemy,</hi> and the <hi>ſaving of a friend,</hi> are compared in the quantitie of difficultie, and that is jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to excell this.</p>
               <p>In theſe Compariſons,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> the greater is brought to ſet out the leſſer, to the end, that the leſſe may ſet out and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare the ſubiect, or thing argued: and the holy Ghoſt himſelfe hath ſhewed vs how to doe it, for in the laſt of the examples, he doth reaſon thus;</p>
               <q>
                  <pb n="115" facs="tcp:18357:62"/>If Chriſts death reconciled an enemie, then his life will ſaue the reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led.</q>
               <p>The reaſon of this conſequence is this, <hi>viz.</hi> (In the judgement of man) the firſt is more difficult then the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond. It is a hard thing to reconcile an enemie; for, then the whole worke is to doe: But not ſo hard to ſaue a friend; for, ſuch a one is next dore to ſalvation. In the ſame ſort, <hi>David</hi> ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues: <hi>If I loue to dwell in Gods houſe, rather then in mans tents; then my af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection is exceeding fervent thereto:</hi> for, mans tents (in the judgement of man) exceed Gods houſe for outward pleaſure, and profit: and after this ſort we may argue from the reſt.</p>

               <p>In theſe Inſtances, the Compariſon we ſeeke for, is very apparent: <hi>A

               <p>Theſe Compariſons doe argue the greater, by the leſſe, and they muſt be framed thus: A fooles wrath a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounds in waight: for, the ſtones and ſand are not ſo heavie as it.

               </p>
               <p>Wee muſt now ſhew,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> how the Genus, and Species, is ſubiected, and predicated: for, that is the ſecond thing we vndertooke. <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> doth
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:18357:71"/>that, partly in the fourth booke of his <hi>Topickes,</hi> the firſt and ſecond Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters: and partly, but more fully, in the fifth Chapter of his <hi>Categories,</hi> where he proceedeth thus: <hi>The Genus is at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed vnto all, and every the Species, that are contained vnder the ſame. The Species is ſubiected to the Genus, the Genus is predicated both of the Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, and the individuall: the Species is predicated of the individuall.</hi> Thus farre <hi>Ariſtotle.</hi> Wee may make this familiar to our vnderſtanding, by theſe examples:
<q>
                     <l>A man is a living Creature.</l>
                     <l>Peter is a man.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>In the firſt, <hi>living Creature</hi> is a Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus, <hi>viz.</hi> of reaſonable, and vnreaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable Creatures. A <hi>man,</hi> is a ſpecies: becauſe it is one kinde of living Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. <hi>Living Creature,</hi> is attributed to man: the Genus to the Species. In the ſecond, <hi>Peter</hi> is an individuall: <hi>Man</hi> is a ſpecies, and thereby we ſee that the ſpecies is predicated of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividuall;
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:18357:72" rendition="simple:additions"/>

                  <pb n="134" facs="tcp:18357:73"/>and conſequently, the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus is predicated of the individuall al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo: for, <hi>the Genus hath no being but in ſome ſpecies,</hi> as <hi>Thomas</hi> hath truly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved. 1. <hi>p. q.</hi> 15. <hi>art.</hi> 3. <hi>ad</hi> 4<hi rend="sup">m</hi>. And the things themſelues do ſay no leſſe. If a man, then a living Creature: ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing every man is a living Creature. By this (I hope) it is plaine, that the ſpecies is ſubiected, and both ſpecies, and Genus are predicated.</p>
               <p>Some man may doubt,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> whether the Genus be not alwayes predicated, and conſequently belongs to thoſe ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments, that are alwayes predicated. I anſwer, the Genus (as it is a Genus) is alwayes predicated, and ſo muſt be, vnleſſe we will divert nature: but that Genus that is ſometimes a ſpecies, is ſubiected: and may be ſo, when it is a ſpecies, and that is enough to bring the Genus vnto this place; for, it makes it ſometime predicated, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time ſubiected. This example will ſhew that I anſwer truly.</p>
               <q>A living Creature, is a living body, able to mone it ſelfe.</q>
               <pb n="135" facs="tcp:18357:73"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>A living Creature,</hi> is a Genus of a man: but a ſpecies of a <hi>living bodie,</hi> and it is ſubiected in the fore ſayd pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition. A living body, is a Genus to a living Creature: for, vnder that is comprehended, the growing plants, that increaſe: but cannot moue them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues: as a living Creature that can both waxe bigger, and moue them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues alſo: now, this Genus is predi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated of a living Creature: therefore, wee may reſt aſſured, that a Genus is ſometimes predicated, and other ſome time ſubiected.</p>
               <p>The third thing that we ſeeke for is,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> whether the Genus, and Species be a ſecond ſubſtance. <hi>Ariſtotle Categor. cap.</hi> 5. proues that they are: on this manner: <hi>They are a ſubſtance, becauſe</hi> 1. <hi>We may truely ſay they be ſomething.</hi> 2. <hi>They appertaine to the eſſence of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry particular being.</hi> 3. <hi>They are ſubiec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vnto others, and others are predica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of them which is proper vnto a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>e. They are a ſecond ſubſtance: becauſe.</hi> 1. <hi>They are Communicated to many.</hi> 2. <hi>They are predicated ſometimes,
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:18357:74"/>and conſequently, they haue not the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per nature of a ſubſtance: for, that is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes ſubiected, in ſo much, as nothing could exiſt, but by reaſon of ſubſtance properly ſo called.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſpecies comes neerer to a firſt ſubſtance then the Genus:
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> becauſe, 1. The ſpecies is in nature, and predi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation neerer to the individuall, then the Genus; as a man is neerer vnto <hi>Peter,</hi> then a living Creature. 2. The Genus, is Communicated to more then the ſpecies. 3. The ſpecies, as it is a ſpecies, is ſubiected alwaies to the Genus: and it ſelfe never predicated; but of the individuall. Theſe things are evident in themſelues: therefore, I need not adde any proofes to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme them, they are eaſie, and open to our vnderſtanding: therefore, I will not ſtand to vnfold them. If any require me to ſhew, how the Genus, and ſpecies doe argue, and ſet out the firſt ſubſtance. I anſwer, that, that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt is not in vaine: becauſe (as <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſtotle</hi> truely ſayth, in the fift Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of his <hi>Categories.) All other things
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:18357:74"/>are predicated of the firſt ſubſtance: therefore, if the firſt ſubſtance were not, none of the reſt could be.</hi> Yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, this place doth not require me to ſhew it: becauſe the inſtances given alreadie, haue done that in part, and the precepts of a definition will ſhew it yet more, but they belong to the ſecond part of <hi>Logicke,</hi> and may not be brought hither, without in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

               <p>I will ſatisfie the demand ſo farre as this place permits, and this one ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence will doe it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Peter is a man.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here, <hi>man</hi> is a ſpecies,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> becauſe it is but one kinde of thing, comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded vnder the name of living Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. The loweſt ſpecies, becauſe no Creatures that haue different formall beings, are contained vnder it. <hi>Peter,</hi> ſignifies a firſt ſubſtance, becauſe it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porteth a thing that cannot be divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, otherwiſe then into matter, and forme; <hi>viz.</hi> his ſoule and body: and they be in <hi>Peter,</hi> as in a whole, not as in a ſubiect; as we learne by <hi>Ariſtotle,

               <p>I haue now (I hope) ſatisfied the demand,

                  <hi>Ramus</hi> himſelfe, they belong to other ſeats of arguments, namely, to them that he calls by the name of privatiue <hi>Arguments;</hi> for, (according to him) <hi>they haue the ſame force to argue that the primitiues haue, from which they are derived;</hi> therefore, they are the ſame with them, ſeeing the nature of every argument ariſeth from its force to argue: but the precepts of them are alreadie diſpatched, and ought not to be repeated againe.</p>
               <p>If any ſay,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> the force that theſe haue to argue ariſeth not firſt, and origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally out of themſelues: but by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection, (as the Moone is conceived to haue her light) and that therefore they ought to haue their owne pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per ſeates in this Art.

               <p>Now wee haue the definition of a ſimple axiome, wee muſt vnfold it: It containeth three things. 1. The termes of it. 2. The extention of one terme to another. 3. The framing of

                  <hi>Arriſtotle</hi> doth not conceiue that an indefinite propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, doth really differ from an vniver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall, and particular. I ſhew it two wayes, firſt, He names it but once in all his writings (ſo faire as I can find.) Secondly, Hee makes a proper pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to be indefinite, onely, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>it wants the ſignes of vniverſall, and particular predication. Prior lib.</hi> 1. <hi>Cap.</hi> 1. now the want of them doth
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:18357:91"/>not make a reall difference, as wee haue already heard by his owne words: againe, they may well be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred vnto vniverſall, or particular: becauſe the extenſion of predication, followes the intent of predicating: and it is not hard to ſhew, where himſelfe makes a propoſition to be generall, that wanteth the terms of all, &amp; none.</p>
               <p>To the ſecond,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> It is true, he makes no propoſition to be proper (in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe words) yet hee doth it in the thing: for, that propoſition is contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned vnder thoſe, which he cals parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, for a particular propoſition (formally) hath an vnlimmited ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect: but vertually it hath a ſingular thing for the ſubiect: when we ſay, <hi>ſome man is learned,</hi> wee aſſigne no man of certaintie, vntill we deſcend to a particular, as <hi>Plato,</hi> or <hi>Ariſtotle &amp;ce.</hi> and this is a proper propoſition according to <hi>Ramus:</hi> moreover, if he meant not to comprehend a proper propoſition, vnder his particular pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, then hee hath omitted one precept, eſſentiall to this Art: I ſay the
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:18357:91"/>doctrine of a proper propoſition is eſſentiall to this Art: and I avow it e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven by the iudgement of <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> himſelfe: for he doth vſe them often, and muſt vſe them oftner then any other: for, hee makes an individuall thing, a ſubiect that receiues all other arguments whatſoever; without which they cannot haue being, nor we any certaine knowledge: but we may not thinke, that he hath omitted it: for that is to charge him vndecent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: (ſeeing he hath deſerved ſo well) and againſt reaſon: becauſe of the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legations alreadie made: to conclude, he doth giue inſtance of a contradic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in ſingular, or proper Axiomes <hi>de interpre. cap.</hi> 10.</p>

               <p>I Doe not finde this precept, either in <hi>Ramus,</hi> or <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> expreſly, yet I bring it by the authority of them both. According to <hi>Ramus,</hi> every precept of Art, is a neceſſary axiome: but (according to him alſo) a Defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and Diſtribution, are precepts of art; therefore, he muſt confeſſe
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:18357:97"/>they bee neceſſary Axiomes. The principles, and foundation of a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration, are neceſſary axiomes: in the iudgement of <hi>Ariſtotle. Poſter. lib.</hi> 1. <hi>Cap.</hi> 2. But a Definition is a principle, and foundation of a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration, even in the ſentence of the ſame <hi>Ariſtotle, Poſter. lib.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 33. <hi>lib.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 3. Therefore, according to him, every Definition is a neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Axiome. Wee may argue the like from his authority, for a Diſtribution: for he inioynes him that makes a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finition, to diſtribute the thing defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned into parts. <hi>Top. lib.</hi> 6. <hi>Cap.</hi> 1. and in framing his art of <hi>Logicke,</hi> he makes Diſtributions to be precepts, no leſſe then Definitions. Laſtly, though I had not their authoritie to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vow this precept, yet I might bring it: becauſe a Definition, and a Diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution haue the nature of a neceſſary Axiome, as we ſhall ſee when we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine them.</p>

               </q>
               <p>THis precept is avowed by <hi>Ariſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle.</hi>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> He makes a Definition to be double, in the thing, though not in words. He ſets out the nature of a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finition, as <hi>Ramus</hi> doth. <hi>A definition</hi> (ſayth he) <hi>is a ſentence that ſignifies
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:18357:98"/>what the thing is. Top. lib.</hi> 1. <hi>Cap.</hi> 5. <hi>A notification of the eſſence, and doth explicate what a thing is. Poſter. lib.</hi> 2. <hi>Cap.</hi> 3.</p>
               <p>A Definition thus ſet out, muſt needs be a perfect one. In the firſt booke of his <hi>Topickes,</hi> and 4. Chapter, he hath theſe words; <hi>There is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that is proper, that ſignifies what a thing is: and ſome other, that doth not ſo ſignifie. The firſt is called a definition, the other is commonly called a thing proper: when it is attributed to the ſame ſubiect with the other.</hi> Now, in this latter place he ſpeakes of a Definition that differs from the former. I ſay it differs. 1. In the name, he ſayth, <hi>this name is but commonly given,</hi> he ſayes not ſo of the former. 2. In this defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the nature of the thing defined is ſet out, and more too: it is explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by properties, that doe not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare the eſſence: and therefore, in all theſe places together, he makes one kinde of definition, that ſets out the nature of the thing onely; and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other that doth ſo, and more too:
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:18357:98"/>and conſequently (according to him) a definition is perfect, and imperfect: and that in the ſence and meaning of <hi>Ramus. Thomas</hi> teacheth the ſame thing expreſly: <hi>A definition</hi> (ſayth he) <hi>is either perfect, or imperfect, that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends the totall being of the thing, as it is conſtituted by all the cauſes. This expreſſeth ſome of theſe, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers conditions alſo: and is called a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription.</hi> 2. <hi>diſt.</hi> 27 <hi>q.</hi> 1. <hi>art.</hi> 2. <hi>ad</hi> 9<hi rend="sup">m</hi>. In this place we ſpeake of a perfect de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finition; and therefore vnto <hi>Thomas,</hi> I will ioyne. <hi>Aliaco:</hi> in him I finde cheſe words; <hi>A good deſcription may be conuerted with the thing defined: not onely for one difference of time; but for all times whatſoever: ſo as, the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate cannot poſſibly be ſevered from the thing defined. Queſt de Reſumpta. lit. Q.</hi> vnto them two, I will ioyne <hi>Richardus de Sancto victore:</hi> for, he is moſt full in explicating of a defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: <hi>De trinitate. lib.</hi> 4. <hi>Cap.</hi> 21. <hi>fol.</hi> 108. <hi>That a definition may be perfect, it ought to comprehend the totall; and onely eſſence of the thing defined: for, as
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:18357:99"/>it borrowes its name from the thing, ſo it ought to extend it ſelfe vnto the vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termoſt limits of the thing defined. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther muſt it exceed it, it ought to agree vnto all, and onely vnto the thing defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and ſo farre, that it may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted into it ſelfe:</hi> Thus farre he.

<pb n="189" facs="tcp:18357:100"/>rude, and vnproper. Fourthly, when the definition is ſo made, that we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not find: how it differs from another that is contrary to it, or what the thing is, that is defined: for then it is like a picture that cannot be knowne whoſe it is, vnles it be ſhewed by writing.</hi> The ſuperfluities of a definition are 6. He ſets them downe in <hi>the third chapter of the ſame booke,</hi> and theſe they are. <hi>Firſt, when one thing is repeated often. Secondly, when a definition is made of arguments that in nature doe follow, and in our knowledge are leſſe knowne then the thing defined. Thirdly, when in the definition the thing defined is brought: cap.</hi> 4. <hi>Fourthly, if a ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior be defined by an inferior.

<pb n="190" facs="tcp:18357:101"/>Top. lib.</hi> 6. <hi>cap.</hi> 3. and therefore I ſhall neede to ſay no more to ſet out the nature of a definition: or what maner of truth is contained in it. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps ſome man will require mee to ſet forth, when a definition contains vntruth: but, I thinke that requeſt needles: becauſe every definition con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines a neceſſary truth that followes theſe rules: and that is vntrue, which doth not obſerue them: but, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits the faults againſt them.</p>
               <p>Although theſe things may ſeeme ſufficient to giue vs knowledge of a definition,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> and the neceſſary truth thereof: yet, I thinke it very needfull to ſet downe a definition, and apply it to the rules alledged.</p>
               <q>A man is a living creature indued with reaſon.</q>
               <p>This is a definition in all mens iudgement. That it agrees to the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer rules, is very manifeſt; for here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in firſt, <hi>Life,</hi> and <hi>Rationalitie</hi> are at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed to all men; and at all times.
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:18357:101"/>Secondly, They are attributed, not by accident, or the application of a third: but, by themſelues, in as much as the eſſence of <hi>Life,</hi> and <hi>Rationali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie</hi> (even of it ſelfe) hath a relation vnto man: and wee apprehend the one, by apprehending the other. Thirdly, <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Rationalitie,</hi> are at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed vnto man vniuerſally: that is, not onely vnto all men, and at all times: but, adaequatly: ſo as, all that is in <hi>Life,</hi> and <hi>Rationalitie,</hi> is ſayd to belong to man: and all that is in man, is denoted, and ſet out by <hi>life,</hi> and <hi>ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionalitie:</hi> the one is as large, and no larger then the other. Fourthly, They are attributed vnto man firſt: that is, they haue no reflexion, or relation to any thing before man: neither is man receptiue of any thing before <hi>life,</hi> and <hi>rationalitie:</hi> but, the firſt act that they doe, is to giue being to man: and the firſt being that man receiues is from life, and rationalitie. 5. <hi>Life,</hi> and <hi>ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalitie,</hi> even ſuch as they are in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, ſuch reference they haue vnto man: in ſo much that man is no more
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:18357:102"/>but an effect compounded of life and reaſon: and they no more but an ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect reſolued into all the cauſes: I ſay all the cauſes, for animalitie ioyned to rationalitie, comprehends all the cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes in it. Whereupon the thing defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, exceeds not the definition; nor the definition is larger then the thing defined: but, they are convertible, wee may truely ſay, If man then a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Creature indued with reaſon; If a living Creature indued with rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, then a man; and both of them containe one, and the ſame truth.</p>
               <p>Thus haue we done with the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finition, we muſt come to a deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion next.</p>

               <p>THis precept is agreed on by all parties,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> as the Reader may finde in the foregoing Chapter: therefore, we need not make doubt, whether it belongs to this art or no; It is reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable cleere: therefore, a few words will prevent all doubtfulneſſe in it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>[A thing]</hi> That is,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> the thing deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed. Now, the thing deſcribed ſeemes to be of ſhorter ſcantling, then the thing defined. A ſingular, or indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duall ſubſtance may be deſcribed: but not defined: for, ſo we heard from <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſtotle</hi> in the foregoing Chapter: and he made it a law, that every definiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on muſt be vniverſall, but that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition where an individuall thing is ſubiected, is not vniverſall.</p>
               <pb n="194" facs="tcp:18357:103"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>[Other Arguments]</hi> Theſe words doe containe the formall nature of an imperfect definition.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> The word <hi>ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument,</hi> importeth an affirmatiue pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication in a deſcription: for diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting arguments cannot deſcribe, nor define: no not in the moſt vnperfect manner: for defining, how imperfect ſo ever it is, muſt needs import, that the thing is in ſome ſort or other: but, diſſenting arguments doe not ſerue in the leaſt ſort to ſet out what a thing is. They haue force to ſhew what a thing is not, and no more. The word <hi>other,</hi> doth ſignifie, that the arguments whereby a thing is deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, are mixed: and are partly eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall, partly without the eſſence. Where wee muſt know, that, the more neere arguments be vnto the eſſence, the more force they haue to ſet out the thing deſcribed: and the more truely that ſentence wherein they are predicated, may be called by the name of a Definition.</p>
               <p>Here it may be doubted,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> whether a Deſcription may be made in any
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:18357:103"/>part by accidents? I anſwer: No acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent (as it is an accident) hath place in a Definition: and I thinke ſo; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> doth perpetually for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid accidents to come within the dores of any Definition. An accident (according to <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>) may in ſome reſpects, and at ſome time become proper: and in that caſe, they may ſerue to deſcribe an individuall ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect: as this, or that ſingular man may be made knowne to vs, and differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced from all others, by riches, lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, &amp;c. which he inioyes and none other.</p>
               <p>Now we ſee what arguments are diſpoſed in a deſcription:
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> and how they are referred the one to the other; it remaineth, that, I declare what truth there is in it. In a Deſcription there is a neceſſary truth. I ſay neceſſary truth, <hi>not of conſtitution</hi> (for that is proper to a perfect definition, where the <hi>thing defined, and the definition doe Conſtitute each other, and is adaquatly the ſame thing:</hi> according to the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of <hi>Thomas,</hi> 1. <hi>diſt.</hi> 25. <hi>q.</hi> 1. <hi>art.</hi> 1.
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:18357:104"/>

If the properties appertaine to an individuall, then they haue a neceſſary connexion therewith, tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough a peculiar right, and poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
               <p>I will adde an inſtance or two,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> and thereby the nature, and truth of this precept will be made evident, and cleere.</p>
               <q>A man is a living Creature, mortall, and capable of learning.</q>
               <p>In this ſentence, man abſtracted from individualitie, (that is, not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered as this or that particular man)
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:18357:104"/>is deſcribed: all the words that follow the Verbe <hi>[is]</hi> containe the deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; Theſe two terms, viz. <hi>mortall, and capable of learning,</hi> are ioyned to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether by that Verbe, and thereby the deſcription is affirmatiue. The word <hi>living Creature</hi> is eſſentiall to man: for, it is the whole ſhott, (as I may ſay) or comprehenſion of all the parts of his nature in generall. The words <hi>capable of learning,</hi> import a thing proper vnto mankinde, that is, as he is formally this kinde of Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which we call man: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that attribute bordreth next of all to mans particular eſſence. The word <hi>mortall,</hi> importeth an accident, now made proper to man. I ſay it is an accident, and no more; becauſe, it flowes not from the principles of his nature. Mans reaſonable ſoule, is the chiefe thing in his being: but mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talitie flowes not from that: for, the ſoule is living, ſo ſayth the Lord: <hi>He breathed in his face the breath of life, and he became a living ſoule,</hi> Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis. 2.7.</p>
               <pb n="198" facs="tcp:18357:105"/>
               <p>Mortalitie is now proper to all men, becauſe they all, are ſubiected to death; I ſay, it is proper to them all, not becauſe they doe, and muſt dye: but becauſe all of them, and none but them muſt dye after that ſort (that is) by accident. All other Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are ſubiect to diſſolution by that nature which they had from God by Creation: but man is ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect to death by impoſition: he incur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red his mortalitie when he ſinned. God threatned it before man ſinned. <hi>Geneſis</hi> 2.17. and inflicted it when man had ſinned. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.12. But that had never beene, if the principles of mans nature had inclined, and fitted him to mortalitie. This being ſo, we may well conclude; mans mortalitie is very little diſtant from mans na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. And conſequently, this propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition is a definition ſomewhat vnper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect.</p>
               <p>There is a neceſſary truth in this Deſcription:
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> for, the thing defined, and that wherewith it is defined, are convertible: the ſentence is equally
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:18357:105"/>true, which wayes ſoever you take it, if it be read as it lyeth, all men will grant it; if we invert the parts, and ſay thus, <hi>Every living Creature that is mortall, and capable of learning is man:</hi> no man will deny it. But this truth is not conſtitutiue: for, mortalitie and capacitie vnto learning (as they are conceived by themſelues, and as they are in themſelues) haue no ſhare in mans eſſence; but is a thing flowing therefrom: and were it not for a third thing that comes betweene them, they might, and might not, belong to man any wayes.

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> that the Genus, and the Integrall, be wholes, (and in that ſence which is now gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven) is confeſſed on all hands.

               <p>IN handling the ſeverall Diſtributi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> it is not greatly materiall, either to art, or the things themſelues; that we beginne with the one rather then with the other: but in my opinion, the diſtribution of the Genus into the Species ought to haue the firſt place; becauſe it is firſt in nature, and obiected firſt to our vnderſtanding, being a comprehenſion of the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular kindes; therefore, I will begin with that.</p>
               <q>
                  <pb n="205" facs="tcp:18357:108"/>The Genus, is diſtributed into the ſpecies, when the generall nature is divided, into ſeverall kindes.</q>

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> doth require it, and their doctrine, and practice avowes it, therefore, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out further labour, I will proceed to the vnfolding thereof.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>[Divided]</hi> This word is made proper to this diſtribution, by the common phraſe of Logicians. The meaning of it is, The generall is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided into the ſpecials, if wee inquire how it is devided to them? it may be anſwered, It is divided two wayes. Firſt, In it ſelfe, being applyed vnto, or (as I may ſay) beſtowed vpon, each kinde: (not in the totall latitude thereof; but ſo farre, as one can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue it). Secondly, Each ſpeciall kinde containes no more then is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded in the generall, what is expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citly in any one of the kindes, is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitly in the whole: what is dilated in that, is thruſt together in this.</p>
               <pb n="206" facs="tcp:18357:109"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>[Severall kindes]</hi> The parts devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded are called ſeverall:
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> becauſe they be ſevered by diſtinct formes. They are called kindes; becauſe both of theſe diſtinct formes are one, and the ſame thing in the generall, or vniver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall, wee ſhall ſee the truth, and evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of this precept (thus vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood) in this inſtance.</p>
               <q>A living Creature, is either reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, or vnreaſonable.</q>
               <p>This ſentence, is a ſimple axiome; becauſe, one thing, is ioyned to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, by a verbe. I ſay one; for though the branches of the predicate, be two, being referred to themſelues; yet they are but one, when they are referred to the ſubiect.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>[Living Creature.]</hi>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Is the whole that is divided. 2. It is an vniverſall whole. 3. The parts into which it is divided, are reaſonable, &amp; vnreaſonable Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. 4. This whole, is beſtowed vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on both parts; becauſe the reaſonable, and vnreaſonable Creatures, (each
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:18357:109"/>of them apart) are truly ſayd to be li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Creatures. 5. Neither the vnrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable, nor reaſonable Creatures haue any thing eſſentiall to them more then is contained in animalitie: for, that word importeth no more, but ſuch a thing, made by God, as hath life, and motion in it ſelfe. Now, that includeth a corporall ſubſtance, and a ſpiritualitie, called life: This as the forme, informing the matter: That as the matter informed. The reaſonable Creature hath no more: thus he hath a bodie made liuely by his ſoule, and that is the matter infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med. He hath a ſoule, or life, and that is the forme informing. We finde the like in the vnreaſonable Creatures, they haue a bodie, wherein their life remaines: this corporall ſubſtance is the matter informed, and that life is the forme informing. 6. Theſe doe differ in their kindes, (I ſay) in their kindes, and not numerically; becauſe, they haue different kindes of corpore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all ſubſtances: ſo the holy Ghoſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounceth of them. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. and
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:18357:110"/>ſo we finde by experience. The fleſh of man and beaſts doe differ in their proper being, and Gods deſtination: for, the one is made to periſh finally, the other to riſe againe. Theſe Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures doe differ alſo in their life or liuelines: the life of beaſts is no more, but as breath that doth vaniſh at their diſſolution: Mans life is more: for, his ſoule is life; being a living, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing, and ſpirituall ſubſtance: and no doubt, but that ſpirituall ſubſtance, is informed by a liuelihood, differing therefrom (though our vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings cannot but gheſſe at it) 1. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe wee finde a ſecret motion of mans vnderſtanding, and will in his ſoule, differing from the ſpirituall ſubſtance thereof. 2. Becauſe mans ſoule liues when it is parted from the body.</p>
               <p>It may be ſome will obiect on this ſort;
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> If the ſpecies containes no more then is in the Genus, then the ſpecifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call difference is alſo contained in the Genus: but this laſt is not true: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, the firſt is vntrue alſo.</p>
               <pb n="209" facs="tcp:18357:110"/>
               <p>I anſwer: I grant the aſſumption; vpon <hi>Ariſtotles</hi> authoritie, and proofe alledged before in the poynt of the Genus. But I deny the conſequence; becauſe it doth ſuppoſe, that the ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cificall difference, is a reall being, conſtituting the ſpecies: but that is vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly vntrue. If that were ſo, then it is a cauſe different from the matter, forme, and end. But the laſt is not true: and this I take as granted: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, the firſt is vntrue alſo; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently, the argument is ſo too, that is founded therevpon. The ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cificall difference, is a rationall entitie and no more; namely, our vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings doe apprehend this kinde, to differ from another, when they are both layd together. Now, this appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion is a veritie, no fiction: for, it hath a foundation in the thing: namely, the ſpecificall forme, our vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding doth thus argue: This hath one kinde of forme, that hath a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, therefore this doth ſpecifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally differ from that. And thus the ſpecificall difference doth flow from
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:18357:111"/>the forme, it is not the ſpecificall forme it ſelfe. Hitherto wee haue ſhewed what arguments are diſpoſed in this kinde of Diſtribution: and the manner how they are diſpoſed; now I will declare that it containes a neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary truth: and I may eaſily doe that, for it fully agrees with the rules of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary truth, ſet downe <hi>Chap.</hi> 34. as will appeare by laying them here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> The parts doe belong to the whole, even to all of it, and at all times; there is no animalitie more then is comprehended in the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, reaſonable, and vnreaſonable. We cannot conceiue a time, wherein the Creatures reaſonable, and vnrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable are not liuing Creatures: and therefore the firſt Rule agrees with this Diſtribution.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Creatures, reaſonable, and vnreaſonable, are living Creatures, even by themſelues, and their owne nature: there is no third thing that comes betweene their nature, and the nature of a living creature, that makes
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:18357:111"/>the one belong to the other: but, they are ſo living creatures by themſelues, that the one is eſſentiall to the other: therefore, this Diſtribution agrees with the ſecond Rule.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Creatures, reaſonable, and vnreaſonable, even in that thing wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they are, they are living creatures; ſo alſo, even in that nature wherein their being doth conſiſt vniverſally, they are living Creatures: yea, and this their nature, wherein they are, they are the firſt thing in living crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; we cannot conceiue any thing in the eſſence of the Creatures, reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, and vnreaſonable, that exceeds the eſſence of a living Creature. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can we imagine, in any ſigne, or moment of reaſon, that there is any thing in the eſſence of a living Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which hath the prioritie, or is before the eſſence of the creature rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable, and vnreaſonable. I ſay be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, either in nature, or time: but in the firſt moment wherein you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue a living Creature to be: you conceiue a creature, either reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:18357:112"/>or vnreaſonable: Wherevpon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimalitie and theſe creatures are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertible. All living creatures, concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved as making one totall ſumme, is no larger in number, then the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures reaſonable, and vnreaſonable; and contrariwiſe. So alſo we may ſay; If a Creature reaſonable or vnreaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, then a living Creature: If a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Creature, then reaſonable or vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable. And conſequently, all the lawes of neceſſary truth agree vnto this Diſtribution.</p>
               <p>If any deſire to know,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> when a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtribution of this kinde, is falſe: let him lay it to theſe rules, and by them he ſhall know. If it agrees not with theſe rules, but comes ſhort, in any part; then it is falſe. And the more it diſagrees from them, the leſſe truth there is in it. Here I will end the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtribution of the Genus, into the ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies.</p>

               <q>The integrall is diſtributed into the members, when the comprehenſiue whole, is parted betweene the things comprehended therein.</q>
               <p>I muſt ſay of this precept, as I did of the laſt; The doctrine, and practice of <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> and <hi>Ramus</hi> doth patro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nize it; therefore, we may take it for a precept of art, though they haue it not in ſo many words; the opening thereof, will ſay, it came from them.</p>
               <p>In this Diſtribution: 1.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> The whole is an individuall. 2. That whole is ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered into peeces, as the timber is by the ſaw, or wedges. 3. The parts haue different, and individuall natures.
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:18357:113"/>4. The whole is made by their mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting together; therefore this ſecond kinde of Diſtribution differs really from the former.</p>

               <p>This propoſition is a ſimple axiome: for, one thing is, attributed to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.

Man is the whole divided, (to wit) an indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duall man. 2. This whole is ſhared, one peice to the bodie, another to the ſoule. 3. The body and ſoule haue diſtinct individuall natures, the one corporeall, the other ſpirituall. 4. The meeting of theſe two parts together, doth make man, as he is an individu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all whole: the ſoule in forming the body, and the body being informed by the ſoule. This ſhall ſuffice to ſhew, what arguments be in this diſtributi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:18357:113"/>and the manner how they are framed together.</p>
               <p>This kinde of diſtribution containes a neceſſary truth: becauſe the lawes of neceſſary truth agree to it.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Soule and body are affirmed of all men ſeverally, and at all times, without exception. 2. Bodie, and ſoule are referred vnto a ſingular man, by themſelues, and their owne eſſence: not by the force of any third. 3. The ſoule, and body, in what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect they are, and in the very eſſence, as they are: they are affirmed of a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular man. I ſay affirmed, both vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally according to the totall nature of themſelues: and according to the eſſence of a ſingular man. So as the eſſence of a ſingular man, and the eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of ſoule, and bodie, are of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall extent: the one is as large, and no leſſe large then the other: ſo alſo, this their nature, is affirmed of man in the firſt inſtant, and moment of his being; and our apprehenſion. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon this whole, and parts, are in their nature convertible. Thus wee

               <q>In a ſimple axiome every argument may be diſpoſed,
<note place="margin">Ramus.</note>except full Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſons, thoſe that conſent, are diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed affirmatinely: and they that diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent negatiuely.</q>
               <p>Full <hi>Compariſons</hi> are iuſtly excepted, out of ſimple axiomes, becauſe they containe foure termes diſtinctly layd, the one to the other, no wayes made one by any Coniunction.</p>
               <p>By <hi>arguments,</hi> is meant ſingle ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments,
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:18357:115"/>for all the foure cauſes toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and eſſentiall properties, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long not to ſimple axiomes of this ſort; they are proper to definitions and diſtributions.</p>
               <p>We ſhall finde neceſſary truth or falſhood in all ſuch axiomes as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce of a thing either as it is in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent being;
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> or as it is paſt. I ſay neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary truth, not ſimply; but after a ſort; becauſe, the <hi>thing that is, or is not, that was, or was not, cannot but be, when it is; nor but not be, when it is not:</hi> as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> hath truely obſerved, <hi>De interpre.

               <p>Simple axiomes that pronounce of a thing to come,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> containe a certaine truth, or falſhood; in reſpect of God: for, he foreknowes all things poſſible by his ſimple intelligence: and all things that ſhall be, by his intuition or knowledge of viſion. In reſpect of mans knowledge, none of thoſe Axiomes do containe a certaine truth; for vnto man, all future things are contingent, and conſequently mans knowledge of them muſt needs alſo
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:18357:115"/>be contingent: vnto Man (I ſay) they are contingent: for as much as, their next cauſes whervpon they depend, are contingent. All humane actions depend vpon mans will, as their next cauſe, and mans will is a facultie free, and indetermined vnto one: and therefore contingent All other things, not humane, are alſo contingent: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, their next cauſe may be hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in their execution. Man is at Gods diſpoſe, and all the other Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are at Gods, and mans. Theſe axiomes may containe a contingent truth, in reſpect of man, and that is all he can haue of them. And here a fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall end for ſimple axiomes.</p>

<pb n="220" facs="tcp:18357:116"/>
                  <q>A compound axiome is that,
<note place="margin">Ramus.</note>the band whereof is a coniunction.</q>
               </p>
               <p>So <hi>Ramus,</hi>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> and thus <hi>Ariſtotle. A ſpeech compounded of ſimple Axiomes, is made one, by a Coniunction, de inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre.</hi> In which words he doth acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge. 1. Some axiomes are compoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded axiomes. 2. Such axiomes are compounded of ſimple Axiomes. 3. They are made one by that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition. 4. Their parts are tyed toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by a Conjunction: therefore, he delivers the ſame precept with <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus,</hi> and vnfolds the meaning of it.</p>
               <p>Thus farre <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> went: but ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver further (for any thing that I can finde:) yet may we not ſay therefore, that his <hi>Logick</hi> is an imperfect art: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it may be all his writings are not come to our hands; If that be ſo, then time hath done iniury both to him and vs. I thinke rather, he omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted compound axiomes of purpoſe. If he did ſo, he had good reaſon for it: for, the precepts of ſimple axiomes giue light enough to ſhew vs how to
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:18357:116"/>iudge of theſe: for theſe being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded of them, they muſt needs be the foundation of theſe: and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, he that can iudge truely of them, cannot be ignorant of theſe. Neither may we accuſe <hi>Ramus</hi> of a ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluitie in art; for, reaſon avowes his deed alſo; becauſe, theſe precepts are convenient, and make the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and vſe of this art more eaſie. 2. Learned men of all ages haue vſed ſuch axiomes as he calls compound: therefore, he might make the precept; of them to be parcell of this art, ſeing vſe, and experience is the miſtris of art. The one did well in omitting; becauſe, he tyed himſelfe to exactnes. The other did well to bring them in, becauſe, he regarded precedent cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome, and future eaſe. We will goe with <hi>Ramus</hi> alone; becauſe, we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not haue <hi>Ariſtotles</hi> company.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>[Axiome]</hi> This word doth put vs in minde, that,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> theſe propoſitions 1. Haue arguments framed in them. 2. They are framed in theſe, in a faſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on differing from ſimple axiomes,
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:18357:117"/>from whence they are called com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound. 3. They containe truth, or falſhood: for ſuch is the condition of all axiomes whatſoever.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>[That]</hi> This word implyeth,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> that, a compound axiome, is but one pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, or enuntiation, as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> calls it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>[Band]</hi> This word giues vs to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtand,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> that, in compound axiomes we ſhall find two diſtinct things tyed together: and in this, they ioyne with ſimple axiomes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>[Coniunction]</hi> By this word wee know, the band of a connext axiome is, a coniunction: and herein ſtands a maine, and principall difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween ſimple, &amp; compound axioms; they had a verbe; theſe haue a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iunction, to tye their parts together. In a ſimple axiome, we found a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate, and ſubiect: in theſe, we finde parts tyed together, but no name for them: we muſt ſeeke for that in the particular axiomes themſelues. This is another reall difference betweene ſimple, and compound axiomes: thus
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:18357:117"/>farre, for their generall nature. This generall is thus divided.</p>

                  <p>Without, ſhall be dogs, and ſercerers, and murtherers, and whoremongers, and Idolaters, &amp;c.</p>
               </q>
               <p>Both theſe propoſitions be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound, according to <hi>Ariſtotle;</hi> for, each of them is made one by a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction: they may be called Copu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latiue, becauſe that Conjunction is Copulatiue. The forenamed axiomes are compounded of ſimple axiomes. The firſt, of two axiomes; the other of fiue. But (according to <hi>Ramus</hi>) both of them be ſimple, becauſe their band is a verbe. Neither of them a compound; for their Conjunction
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:18357:118"/>tyes not the parts of the propoſition together; for, it neither affirmes, nor inferres truth, or falſhood. It tyeth one part of the Axiome together, and makes it one by the knitting together of divers parts, and no more. If we take a veiw of them as they lye, wee ſhall ſee all theſe things plainely.</p>
               <p>In the firſt inſtance,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 
                  <hi>Chriſt</hi> is the ſubiect, <hi>death,</hi> and <hi>reſurrection,</hi> are made the predicate: both of theſe are ioyned together by the word <hi>And:</hi> and thereby they are made one; that is, not one thing: but one truth toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. This one predicate, is referred vnto that ſubiect, by the verbe that is included in them both, in the truth of the thing, the firſt containes two axiomes. Chriſt dyed, Chriſt did riſe from death, and we finde the ſame truth in them both, being taken apart, that we doe, when both the predi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates are put together into one axiom. The ſame is the caſe with the ſecond, when it ſtands in due forme, thus:
<q>Whoremongers, I dolaters, Lyers, &amp;c. haue no right to heaven.</q>
               </p>
               <pb n="226" facs="tcp:18357:119"/>
               <p>In the truth of the thing, this is a ſimple axiome, as the former was: the predicate <hi>damnation,</hi> is referred to the ſubiect <hi>Whoremongers, &amp;c.</hi> by a verbe: the ſubiect conſiſteth of divers parts, diſtinct betweene themſelues, <hi>Whoremongers, I delaters, &amp;c.</hi> all thoſe parts are made one by the word <hi>And.</hi> I ſay one, not in themſelues: but in the truth of this propoſition, ſo as, if wee referre damnation to them all ioyntly, it containes a certaine truth. If that predicate be referred vnto Whoremongers alone, Lyers alone, &amp;c. each one of them doe containe a truth, no leſſe certaine, and vndoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>A Contradiction is made to this kinde of axiome, by denying the word <hi>And:</hi> for, thereby we ſay, all the parts vnited together, doe not agree vnto the other part, to which they are referred.</hi>
               </q>
               <p>This precept is made evident,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> by either of the examples alledged. If I ſay damnation belongs not to whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongers,
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:18357:119"/>Chriſt ſuffered not death; I put an expreſſe Contradiction to them both, if theſe be true, thoſe be falſe. If they be true, theſe be falſe: but, this Contradiction is the ſame with ſimple axiomes: for, one, and the ſame predicate, is denyed of one, and the ſame ſingular ſubiect: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we may conclude, theſe ſentences are compound Copulatiue propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in their preſent forme; but ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple propoſitions in the truth of the thing. If you take them, as men doe ſpeake them, then they are co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pound: if you take them as men ought to ſpeake, then they are ſimple.

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> each of them are made one by a coniunction, that ſo tyes both the parts together, that, they containe ſuch truth, as the parts doe not, when they are taken in ſunder, and each one by it ſelfe.

               <p>Theſe compound axiomes,

               <p>The parts knit together in this kind of axiomes, are named <hi>Antecedent,</hi>

The ſecond followes the firſt, and receiues its being there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>from: All arguments may be diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in this axiome, that haue place in a ſimple axiome: becauſe, this ſerueth to conclude all queſtions, that may be concluded by a ſimple axiome: ſo alſo they may be diſpoſed in the ſame manner in this, that they may in a ſimple, (that is) Conſenting argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments affirmatiuely, and Diſenting negatiuely.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>The truth of this axiome dependeth vpon the Connexion of the parts; ſo as, if the one doth follow vpon the other, then the axiome is true; otherwiſe it is falſe, therefore, if the one doth neceſſarily inferre the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, then the truth of it is alſo ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary.

By this alſo, we know what we muſt proue, when wee would avow a connext axiome: namely, not the parts them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues; but the following of the later vpon the former. If this oppoſition to a connex axiome may with reaſon be called a contradictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in any ſence, then in this art it may goe for a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction indeed: but I doubt whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in reaſon it may be ſo called or no: becauſe, the whole band that tyes the parts of this axiome together,
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:18357:123"/>is not denyed: and Conſequently, there is not an oppoſition made of one propoſition vnto the ſame propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: for one thing is not ſevered from that ſubiect, vnto which it was ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned: but onely the ſame thing is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed to follow, which was once af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed to follow: and theſe things may ſuffice to ſet out the nature of a connext axiome.</p>
               <p>Before I make a full end of this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept, I muſt ſhew what affinitie, or rather foundation, a connexe axiome hath with a ſimple. I may truely ſay, a ſimple axiome, and this compound differ nothing but in the manner of pronouncing. Men vſually ſpeake in a connexe forme, becauſe the manner is more familiar in many things: but they ſhould ſpeake in the forme of a ſimple axiome, in the exactnes of art: therefore, we may reſolue theſe into them: as I will ſhew by the inſtances alledged.</p>
               <p>The firſt example of a connexe axiome, viz. <hi>If in this life onely &amp;c.</hi> may be reduced vnto a ſimple axiom
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:18357:123"/>in every mans iudgement: becauſe, it hath but three termes in it: but in truth, it is ſomewhat difficult whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it may be ſo reduced or no: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, it pronounceth of ſome kinde of men, not vniverſally of all: yet it may be done truely, and plainely, if we firſt know, that the antecedent part ought to be ſet downe in theſe words: <hi>They that haue no happineſſe but in this life, and here they haue <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>.</hi> I ſay, theſe laſt words muſt be added: becauſe, the Connext axiome doth ſuppoſe them, and therevpon inferres the Conſequent: which otherwiſe it could not doe. Thoſe words being added, we may bring this Connext axiome, and the Apoſtles whole diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation therefrom, into this ſimple forme.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>They that haue no happineſſe but in this life, and here, they haue name, they onely are miſerable.</p>
                  <p>But we onely are not miſerable.</p>
                  <p>Therefore we haue ſome happineſſe which is not in this life.</p>
               </q>
               <pb n="236" facs="tcp:18357:124"/>
               <p>The other Connext propoſition, viz. <hi>If righteouſnes be by the &amp;c.</hi> is yet more difficult: yea ſo difficult, that, if we take it as it lyes, it is not to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced vnto a ſimple for me: for it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines two propoſitions every way di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct: and therefore, it hath foure termes, viz. 1. <hi>Righteouſnes.</hi> 2. <hi>Law.</hi> 3. <hi>Chriſt.</hi> 4. <hi>Vaine:</hi> but if we take the Apoſtles whole diſputation together, and frame it according to art, it will eaſily make a ſimple forme: for thus the Apoſtle diſputeth.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>They that maintaine this ſentence, Iuſtice comes by the Law, they muſt maintaine this ſentence alſo, Christ dyed in vaine.</p>
                  <p>But no man may ſay, Chriſt dyed in vaine.</p>
                  <p>Therefore no man may ſay, Iuſtice comes by the Law.</p>
               </q>
               <p>To conclude this point of Connext axiomes; I hope it doth now ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare, that, they are fundamentally, and indeed no other but ſimple.
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:18357:124"/>Therefore whatſoever belongs vnto them, it is due firſt vnto ſimple axiomes, and Conſequently, they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riue the ſame from them. They differ onely in manner of pronouncing, and not otherwayes. It is now time that I proceed to a Diſcrete Axiome.</p>

<pb n="238" facs="tcp:18357:125"/>place in Art. Wee ſhall vnderſtand it the better, if we put an inſtance or two. There bee different kindes of this alſo; I will propound one of each, that wee may be the better a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to iudge of them, as occaſion ſerues.</p>
               <q>
                  <list>

                  </list>
               </q>
               <p>Theſe are compound Axiomes in the iudgement,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> both of <hi>Ramus</hi> and <hi>Ariſtotle:</hi> for in them, two ſimple Axiomes are ioyned together by a coniunction; and thereby each of them is one intire ſentence. I ſay one ſentence, in their voyce of pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing, though the coniunction doth thruſt the parts one from another: for theſe propoſitions doe ſay, hee that hath the firſt may bee with out the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond: and thereby pronounce but one thing.</p>
               <pb n="239" facs="tcp:18357:125"/>
               <p>In theſe Axiomes,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> diſſenting ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments onely are diſpoſed: and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentingly in the ſame manner as they are diſpoſed in ſimple Axiomes: for what can be ſevered from the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect, but thoſe arguments that diſſent from it. The parts of this Axiome can haue no name: becauſe, it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines nothing that doth antecede, or follow; vnleſſe we will giue it thoſe names which belong to a ſimple Ax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iome.</p>
               <p>The coniunction which tyes the parts together, is called <hi>diſcrete:</hi>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> and in this place it imports no more but a thing that keepes two aſunder, for the preſent, that, at another time may meete together. If we examine theſe two examples, wee ſhall eaſily vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the rule. In the firſt, <hi>not fearing of ill;</hi> is denyed to him that <hi>walkes in the vale of death:</hi> not ſimply and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely, as if no man could ſo <hi>walke,</hi> and <hi>feare ill;</hi> but as a thing which was ſevered for that time onely; or that did ariſe vpon that occaſion. In the ſecond example, there ſeemes ſome
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:18357:126"/>difficultie: becauſe it conſiſteth one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of conſenting arguments: for a <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant profeſſion of faith,</hi> and <hi>guiltines of a fault,</hi> are attributed to one ſubiect: The ſecond example, is like the firſt, if wee frame it exactly according to Art, it will haue theſe wordes.</p>
               <q>Although thou didſt well in theſe, <hi>yet</hi> thou didſt not well in ſome other things.</q>
               <p>In this propoſition;
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> 
                  <hi>ill doing in ſome things,</hi> is attributed vnto a <hi>well doer</hi> in ſome other things: but theſe two differ only in reſpect of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent time, and thoſe parties, they dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer not of their owne nature. For theſe that did ill in ſome things, might haue done well in all.</p>
               <q>A diſcrete Axiome is iudged to bee true,
<note place="margin">Ramus.</note>if both parts be true; and good, if both partes be divers.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>[Good]</hi> That is in reſpect of the forme.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> A diſcrete Axiome is then framed according to Art, when the partes of it doe diſſent by diverſitie,
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:18357:126"/>not as oppoſites. This rule muſt bee vnderſtood of ſuch Axiomes, as are moſt agreeable to Art, and in that ſence it is moſt true. If it be vnderſtood vniverſally, it is not true. If I ſhall ſay, <hi>although I am rich yet I am not poore.</hi> I ſhall frame my diſcretiue Ax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iome according to Art: for I ſever povertie from riches, not ſimply, and every way: but onely as proceeding from, or bearing company with ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches: and that is enough to make it a formall diſcrete Axiome: becauſe this ſerues for no other end, but to take away an illation, and to ſeuer a thing falſly inferred, from the thing that did inferre the ſame. Such an Axiome is ridiculous I grant, but in him that would haue riches, and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertie goe together, not in him that denies their going together.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>[Both parts true]</hi> This rule holds in every diſcretiue Axiome whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever. The Axiome is falſe,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> vnles both parts be true ſome wayes or other: for in every Axiome of this kinde, the firſt part is let paſſe as true. In ſome
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:18357:127"/>Axiomes it is ſo indeede, and in the thing: but in ſome other it is ſo in courteſie onely: not in the thing. The ſecond part muſt alwaies be true, otherwiſe it denyes not the inference oppoſed thereby: and therefore it pronounceth not as the thing is. The examples formerly aleadged, will make the matter plaine. In the firſt, <hi>David</hi> preſumes, that, hee did <hi>walke through the vale of death;</hi> and ſo hee did indeede: yet he denyes, that ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he was made <hi>to feare ill.</hi> If he had <hi>feared ill,</hi> then hee had pronounced falſely. If neither himſelfe, nor any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther had preſumed, that, he did <hi>walke in the vale of death;</hi> then (for that alſo) he had pronounced falſely, for in both theſe caſes, hee had pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced otherwiſe then the thing was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede. The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> 2. Cor. 11 6. is content to yeeld his accuſers, that, he was <hi>rude in ſpeech:</hi> yet hee denyes that he is <hi>ſo in knowledge.</hi> The firſt is true by conceſſion onely; not in the thing: for his ſpeech was excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, both for Logicke, and Retho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricke,
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:18357:127"/>as his diſputation and exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations doe witneſſe. The ſecond is true indeede, otherwiſe he had made no anſwere to them that argued him ſlender in knowledge: becauſe hee was <hi>rude in ſpeech.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Hitherto I haue opened the nature of diſcretiue Axiomes,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> it remaines that I ſhew how they be ſupported by a ſimple Axiome. Touching that I ſay, In the thing it is no more but a ſimple Axiome, as the yce is no more but water: for Art will reſolue theſe Axiomes into ſimple, as heate, and raine doth diſſolue the yce. The firſt example is no more but as if <hi>David</hi> had ſayd, <hi>walking through the vale of death, and the feare of ill, doe not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes goe together.</hi> In the ſame ſort, <hi>Paul</hi> anſwers to his accuſers: <hi>Rude ſpeech and ſlender knowledge, are not companions.</hi> Hereupon wee may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude: diſcretiue Axiomes, are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded as they are pronounced: but they are ſimple as they ought to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved: therefore whatſoever belongs to a ſimple Axiome, appertaines to them alſo.</p>

               <q>That axiome is disiunct,
<note place="margin">Ramus.</note>whoſe band is a disiunctiue Coniunction.</q>
               <p>Theſe axiomes are ſeldome in vſe,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> and when we finde them, they are ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther diſputations by Syllogiſme, then ſingle ſentences by themſelues, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing truth or falſhood: yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, I will vnfold their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that we may haue a true iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of them. We may ſee that, in this inſtance;</p>
               <q>Either Saul ſhall liue for ever, or dye by Gods hand, or the enemies ſword, or the courſe of nature. <hi>1. Sam. 26.10.</hi>
               </q>
               <p>This ſentence is a compound axiom,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
                  <pb n="245" facs="tcp:18357:128"/>both according to <hi>Ramus,</hi> and <hi>Ariſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle:</hi> for divers ſingle propoſitions are tyed together, and made one by a Coniunction.</p>
               <p>This ſentence alledged, is a disjunct axiome: for the band that tyes the parts together, is disjunctiue. <hi>Perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall life,</hi> and <hi>death at laſt,</hi> are attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to <hi>Saul:</hi> one of them certainly, neither of them diſtinctly, but both disjoynedly.</p>
               <p>Oppoſites onely haue place in this axiome: for none may be disioyned,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> or thruſt the one from the other, but ſuch onely as in their nature cannot agree to the ſame ſubiect, in the ſame reſpect, part, and time.</p>
               <p>The truth of theſe propoſitions, is meaſured according to the oppoſites diſpoſed in them; if they containe ſuch as one of them muſt be in the ſubiect, (and are alſo) without a third thing to come betweene them, then the propoſition is neceſſary, thorough the oppoſition of the parts: the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample now alledged is of this kinde; <hi>Perpetuall life,</hi> or <hi>death at l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="246" facs="tcp:18357:129"/>them (I ſay) muſt needs befall <hi>Saul,</hi> theſe two haue no third to come be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene them, therefore it cannot be avoyded: but he muſt either liue per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually, or dye at laſt. If wee will Contradict this propoſition, we muſt ſay; <hi>Saul</hi> ſhall neither liue for ever, nor dye once: this is neceſſarily falſe: becauſe, the other is neceſſarily true.</p>
               <p>If a disjunctiue propoſition con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine ſuch oppoſites,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> as one whereof muſt be in the ſubiect, and the ſayd oppoſites haue a meane betweene them, then the disjunction is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary; when as all that comes betweene them be ſufficiently reckoned vp (as for example) This <hi>action is either ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernaturally good, or ſupernaturally e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill, or naturally good, or naturally evill.</hi> Here we haue a neceſſary truth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe every action of man is either good, or evill: and there is no other thing comes betweene ſupernaturall good, and ſupernaturall evill, but na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall good, or naturall evill. The Contradiction of this disjunction is made, when we ſay, there is ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:18357:129"/>thing that comes betweene ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernaturall good, and ſupernaturall evill: beſides naturall good, and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall evill.</p>
               <p>If I make a disiunctiue propoſition thus: <hi>Socrates, is either, a Father,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> or a Childe:</hi> then this propoſition containes a coniecture, or opinion, no neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry truth: for it might come to paſſe, that he was no father, becauſe he hath no childe; nor no childe, becauſe he hath no father. Thus (I hope) the nature of disjunct axiomes, is made plaine enough.</p>
               <p>Theſe axiomes doe ſavour no leſſe of them that be ſimple,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> then all the former compound axiomes haue done. Theſe are compound in the words wherein they are vttered: but they are ſimple, in the ſenſe wherein they are vnderſtoood. The examples alledged, may be thus reduced; <hi>He that muſt once dye, ſhall not liue for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver. That action, that is ſupernaturally good, is neither naturally good, nor na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally evill, nor ſupernaturally evill.</hi> Wherevpon wee may conclude,
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:18357:130"/>whatſoever belongs to a ſimple Axiome, containing theſe arguments, the ſame belongs to disjunct axioms. Now at the laſt, we are come to an end of all <hi>Logicall</hi> precepts, that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne the making of axiomes.</p>

Prior. lib.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 23. From whence it followes, that, in every Syllogiſme there are three termes, and no more. If there be any other part beſides theſe three, it is called a proſyllogiſme. <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> teacheth the ſamething. <hi>It is manifeſt</hi> (in his iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) <hi>that, every Syllogiſme is made by three termes, and no more: if there be more third arguments then one, there are more Syllogiſmes then one.

                  <hi>[Antecedent]</hi> This ſignifies the two firſt propoſitions in a Syllogiſme,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> from whence the third is concluded: ſo ſayth <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> alſo: <hi>It is plaine that a Syllogiſme conſiſts of two propoſitions, and not of more: for, the three termes doe make thoſe two propoſitions. Prior. lib.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 25.</p>
               <p>The firſt, is called the propoſition, becauſe, it containes at leaſt the predi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate, or Conſequent part of the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion. The ſecond, is called the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption;
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:18357:132"/>becauſe, it is taken out of the firſt. According to <hi>Ariſtotle, the firſt, hath the name of Maior, becauſe, it containes the predicate part of the queſtion: the ſecond, the title of Minor, becauſe, the ſubiect part of the queſtion is diſpoſed in it.

<pb n="254" facs="tcp:18357:133"/>out of him, as we ſhall ſee when we vnfold the parts of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>[Simple]</hi> This word is giuen to a Syllogiſme,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> after the ſame ſort, that it was given to an axiome, even be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, the third argument is diſpoſed with the queſtion without coniuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or compoſition.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>[Conſequent part,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> &amp;c.]</hi> Theſe words ſhew wherein a Syllogiſme is ſimple, and how the ſame ought to be fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med. It is <hi>ſimple,</hi> becauſe one terme of the queſtion, and the third argument makes each propoſition: and theſe two propoſitions inferre a third, which is a ſimple axiome alſo. The predicate part of the queſtion, muſt be framed with the third argument, in the propoſition: and the ſubiect part with the third argument in the aſſumption; not ſo much becauſe, men haue ſayd ſo: but becauſe nature will haue it ſo: this example will ſhew it. One ſayth, <hi>Socrates is vertuous:</hi> another doubts of it: if I would proue it to be true, a third argument muſt be brought, that ſhall tye the predi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:18357:133"/>and ſubject of that propoſition together. Now then, for that end I bring the terme <hi>Iuflice.</hi> If this terme be diſpoſed in a Syllogiſme, it muſt be framed after this ſort; <hi>He that is Iuſt, is vertuous: but Socrates is Iuſt. Therefore he is vertuous.</hi> I ſay nature appoints this frame; becauſe, Iuſtice is a ſpeciall vertue, therefore where Iuſtice is, vertue needs muſt be. Therefore <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> was a true fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lower of nature, when he appointed to diſpoſe arguments on this manner. <hi>Prior. lib.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 4. To conclude, from hence it is manifeſt, that, the Concluſion inferred, by every true ſimple Syllogiſme, muſt be gathered out of the propoſition, and aſſumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on after this manner, <hi>viz.</hi> The ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent, or ſubiect part of the conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, out of the aſſumption; and the conſequent, or predicate part, out of the propoſition: and where this is not found, the Syllogiſme is falſe, and concludes nothing.</p>
               <p>As we found in a ſimple axiome,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> ſo ſhall we finde in a ſimple Syllogiſme:
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:18357:134"/>affirmation, and negation: generali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and ſpecialitie.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Affirmatiue,

Wherefore, if the Concluſion be vniverſall, the termes muſt be vniver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall. But the termes may be vniverſall, and yet the concluſion not vniverſall.</hi> In every <hi>Syllogiſme, either both or one of the propolitions muſt be like the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion. Affirmatiue, or negatiue, neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, or Contingent.

               <pb n="257" facs="tcp:18357:134"/>

               <p>
                  <hi>[Contract]</hi> This word giues the name vnto this forme.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> In common ſpeech it ſignifies a thing cruſht toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: or drawn into a narrow roome: the reaſon of the name ariſeth from the nature of the thing; namely, the ſhort, &amp; briefe diſpoſing of the third argument with the queſtion, in this figure. Wherein it differs from the reſt: and it muſt bee ſo contract, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe wee finde it ſo in the common vſe of men, and not otherwiſe vnfol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>[Argument brought &amp;c.]</hi>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> By theſe words, and the reſt which follow, the different kind of this forme is ſet out
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:18357:137"/>by foure properties, whereof this is the firſt namely, that the third argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, (or middle terme which is v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to proue, that the latter part of the queſtion is rightly ioyned vnto, or ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered from the former part) is put for an example, or an inſtance aſſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the thing wherein the queſtion concluded is true: as wee ſhall ſee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non in the Syllogiſme it ſelfe.</p>
               <p>In this all the <hi>Logick</hi> Schooles doe agree.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Firſt they call this forme an <hi>Expoſitory Syllogiſme onely,</hi> becauſe the third argument is as it were an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, or commentary to vnfold the truth of the queſtion concluded: or elſe, becauſe the argument doth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the indeterminate ſubiect part of the queſtion, vnto one certaine, and ſingular thing: as wee ſhall ſee when wee come to giue inſtance of this precept. Secondly; The Authors of beſt credit doe expreſly teach the ſame thing with <hi>Ramus, An expoſite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Syllogiſme</hi> (ſayth <hi>Aliaco</hi> 1 <hi>ſent. q.</hi> 5. <hi>lit.</hi> Z.) <hi>is then good, when the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle terme importeth one thing, and no
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:18357:137"/>more. If it comprebend many diſtinct things, it is naught.</hi> According to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſtotle,</hi> this forme concludes particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar queſtions onely, as hath beene ſhewed, <hi>cap.</hi> 49. therefore in his iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the third argument muſt bee put for an example, for ſuch queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons cannot be proved by any other.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>[Particular queſtion]</hi> This is the ſecond propertie of this form,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> no que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions are concluded here, but parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular: and ſo ſayth <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> in the chapter going before, and hee adds, that, they are concluded three wayes by it. If therefore any queſtion that is generall, or proper; be concluded in this figure, then the Syllogiſme is falſe, and proues nothing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>[Antecedent in both parts]</hi> This is the third propertie of this forme,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> the third argument hath the firſt place, or is ſubiected both in the propoſition, and aſſumption. <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> hath the ſame thing expreſly in the 49. Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: <hi>The middle terme</hi> (ſay the <hi>Ieſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ites,</hi> in their commentary vpon <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtotle: Prior. lib.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 6.) <hi>is ſubiected

                  <hi>[Aſſumption affirmed]</hi> This is the laſt propertie of this figure.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> 
                  <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> requires the ſame thing too: namely, that, the firſt extreame be affirmed of the middle terme, therefore the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption is affirmed: for (according to him) the firſt extreame is alwayes diſpoſed in the aſſumption: and the Ieſuites in the place laſt alledged doe expreſly teach, that, in the third figure the <hi>Minor</hi> muſt alwayes be affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue.</p>

               <p>Here we finde a particular queſtion concluded.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> Some confidence, &amp;c. This I ſay is particular; becauſe, ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue is attributed to confidence, but in ſome part, not to all kinde of confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence vniverſally. The third argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is a ſingular thing, <hi>viz.</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy,
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:18357:138"/>and this is put as an example, or ſingular inſtance; reducing the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>determinate ſubiect part of the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion vnto one determinate thing: and thereby expounding, or vnfol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding that which was darke, by that which is cleere, and expoſing vncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taintie to a certaintie.

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> and in the thing: but (according to him) we muſt follow nature in every pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of <hi>Logicke,</hi> and that is as much as if he had ſayd ſo: for nature com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, that, ſome Syllogiſmes be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicate, and not contract: becauſe no third argument, that ſerues to proue a queſtion that is vniverſall or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, can be put as an example of ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:18357:141"/>of them; therefore there muſt be ſome Syllogiſmes explicate, that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be contracted: and there may be ſome contracted, that need not be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicated; and conſequently (accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to nature) ſome Syllogiſmes may be explicate, and ſome contract.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> The preſence of the two propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and concluſion is a ſufficient rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why we ſhould call a Syllogiſme explicate: for thereby it is vnfolded to the full. The firſt propertie, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs vnto the Syllogiſmes of this kinde, is this, viz. <hi>The propoſition is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes generall, if the concluſion be vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſall, or particular, if the concluſion be proper, then the propoſition is proper alſo.</hi> Now, this law followes the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing of the third argument, with the queſtion: not the will or device of man (as we ſhall ſee by the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular inſtances;) <hi>The concluſion muſt be like the propoſition, and aſſumption, when both of them are vniverſall, and affirmatiue, or proper, and affirmatiue, then the concluſion muſt be ſo too, when the aſſumptionis particular, and nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue,

<pb n="275" facs="tcp:18357:143"/>I anſwere, it is not materiall, whether of them be firſt, or laſt: for, no one of them doth giue light, or knowledge to the other: neither doth it further our vſe of them, when this is ſet before that, or that before this: <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> preferred the one, becauſe all queſtions might be concluded in it: <hi>Ramus</hi> preferd another, becauſe the argument is diſpoſed with the queſtion after a more ſingle, or ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple maner: therefore both did well ſo farre as they had reaſon, neither of them did better, becauſe (as I ſayd) their order doth neither profit, nor hinder their vſe, therefore I haue ſaid enough to ſatisfie the doubt, and will goe on to ſhew how this rule may be vſed.</p>

               <p>I anſwer; this conceit is very vaine: for, cannot any of the cauſes, or all of them together, ſerue to proue a ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence that is called into queſtion? or cannot the cauſes be diſpoſed with a queſtion into two propoſitions? Without doubt they may. Alſo, it is moſt certaine, that, every propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on comprehends a neceſſary truth, wherein the effect is argued by the cauſes; for the effect is no more, but a comprehenſion of all the cauſes: and when the cauſes doe argue the effect, the effect is reſolued into the cauſes; therefore when we know the cauſes we cannot but know the effect. And conſequently, ſuch propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are neceſſary; and what they are, ſuch the concluſion muſt be, that is lawfully inferred from them.</p>
               <p>If there may be premiſes, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion anſwerable to this rule, then
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:18357:148"/>no doubt, there be examples of it, and we may ſhew them if need were, but I will ſaue that labour for this time, for divers reaſons. 1. <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> hath done that alreadie, <hi>Poſter. lib.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 11. ſo as, he that will, may make vſe of them. 2.

I ſay, a man may finde them by practice, becauſe <hi>by ſence we get memory, by the remembring the doing of the ſame thing often, we get experience, by our many times remembring, our experience is

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> we haue an example of this kinde of Connexe, that ſeemes to be ſomewhat more dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult; Where the Apoſtle reaſons thus:
<q>
                     <p>If Chriſt be riſen, then other men ſhall riſe.</p>
                     <p>But Chriſt is riſen: ſo I haue prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, and you beleeue.</p>
                     <p>Therefore the bodies of men ſhall riſe.</p>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>I ſay, this example is more difficult then the former: for, the propoſition hath two intire, and diſtinct ſimple axiomes in it: but it may be reduced, and brought into this forme.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>They that ſay, that Chriſt is riſen, muſt ſay, that men ſhall riſe.</p>

               </q>
               <p>And this is wholly agreeable to the Apoſtles diſputation: for he argueth againſt them that denyed the laſt: but in his judgement they might not doe ſo; becauſe they did confeſſe the firſt.

<pb n="301" facs="tcp:18357:156"/>thing is taken for granted, and that muſt be granted, or elſe they can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude nothing.</p>
               <p>By the word <hi>[one]</hi> is meant,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> not one terme; but one part of the oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition: for, we muſt remember, that, no arguments but oppoſites come in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Syllogiſmes of this kinde; now oppoſites are ſometimes one, againſt one, and ſome other times many a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt one: ſo as, thoſe many make one part, and the other one, makes the other part: therefore, it is truely ſayd, one is taken away, when all thoſe are contradicted that make one part of the oppoſition: and one is aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed, when thoſe many are barely repeated. Againe, that word <hi>one,</hi> is not vnderſtood indifferently of either part of the oppoſition: for then, the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tradicting of any one ſingle terme, muſt inferre the concluding of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers that oppoſe that one: but that may not be: for onely one of them at once, can agree to the ſame ſubiect, in the ſame reſpect, part, and time. Therefore it is vnderſtood of all the

               <p>By this precept the propoſition may be negatiue in ſome part,

               <p>This argument doth preſume, that <hi>David</hi> muſt vndergoe one of theſe three, and no more, but that one. If that be granted, it doth inferre the Concluſion neceſſarily.

               </q>
               <p>The propoſition preſumes, that one of the three muſt be indured, and no more but one of them. If that be granted, the whole argument is good, if that be denyed, it hath no force to proue.</p>
               <p>I will adde one example more,

               </q>
               <p>Here is ſuppoſed, that every man hath one of theſe two, and but one of theſe: and thereupon, it inferres the concluſion neceſſarily: otherwiſe not.

<pb n="305" facs="tcp:18357:158"/>whether of them two had beene Contradicted in the aſſumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and concluded, or barely repeated in the Concluſion: for the forme of Syllogiſme, and force of truth, is the ſame in both: and this doth make it differ from the two former. If we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to ſee it made a ſimple ſyllogiſme, we muſt frame it thus.</p>
               <q>
                  <l>He that is not iuſt, is vniuſt.</l>

               <q>
                  <p>This action, is either ſupernaturally good, or ſupernaturally evill, or na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally good, or naturally evill.</p>
                  <p>But it is ſupernaturally good.</p>

               <p>The reaſon why one oppoſite terme onely, is aſſumed; and the reſt contradicted, is: becauſe but one op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite, can be in the ſubject at once, and the preſence of that, doth inforce the abſence of the reſt.</p>

               <p>I doubt not,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> but this will ſuffice to ſhew the truth, and vſe of this precept. It is needles for me to ſet forth what truth is contained in theſe Syllo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſmes; for if we take them as diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junctiue, then they containe truth no
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:18357:160"/>otherwiſe then as disiunctiue axioms doe. If we take them as ſimple, then they muſt be referred vnto ſimple Syllogiſmes: therefore in the precepts of them, we ſhall know what truth is contained in theſe. I might alſo al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the reaſon why <hi>Ramus</hi> doth proſecute all the precepts of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound Syllogiſmes; and thereby ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie him. And for what cauſe <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtotle</hi> did but name them, &amp; not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute them; and ſo juſtifie him alſo; but (I thinke) I haue done that ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently in the matter of Compound Axiomes. <hi>Cap.</hi> 42. they, and theſe, draw in one, and the ſame line: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I referre the Reader vnto that place. Repetitions are but loſt la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour.</p>
               <p>Now we are come to an end of all the precepts of <hi>Logicke:</hi> ſo as,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> there is no more required, to make a Logici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, then what hath beene ſayd alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die. But that ſeemes not enough to <hi>Ramus,</hi> for he brings another mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of this art, and calls it <hi>Methode:</hi> but I omit the ſame of purpoſe; for
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:18357:161"/>divers reaſons. 1. No precepts of <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicke</hi> can teach it, becauſe even (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to him) <hi>Method is no more, but the orderly placing of ſentences to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.</hi> But the precepts of <hi>Logicke</hi> cannot teach that, it being no more, but the generall nature of art, as wee haue alreadie found <hi>Cap.</hi> 1. (I ſay of <hi>art</hi> ſimply, abſtracted from all parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars, and not applyed to <hi>Rhetorick, Logicke,</hi> or any other; as we do when we ſay <hi>Rhetoricke</hi> is an art &amp;c.) 2. If any precepts of <hi>Logicke,</hi> haue power to teach the orderly framing of ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences together, then they muſt be, either ſome that are paſt, or ſome that are yet to come: if we muſt haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to theſe, then their Authors, and places muſt be named. But that is impoſſible. If the precedent pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts do teach it, then we haue done enough alreadie, and can doe no more, except wee will repeat the ſame things againe. 3.
